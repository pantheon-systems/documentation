# Contributing
Help us create relevant and useful content for developers like yourself. See something you'd like to add or change? We love pull requests!

I'm an arbitrary change, I shouldn't be merged, oh no.

**NOTE**: All contributions must be licensed under [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Code snippet contributions must additionally be licensed under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). You must have permission to contribute your work under these terms.

If you're looking for a place to start, try copying our [Doc Template](/source/content/doc-template.md) file and using it to outline your new doc.

## Code of Conduct
Pantheon is dedicated to a positive and harassment-free community experience for everyone. [See our full code of conduct](source/_docs/code-of-conduct.md) for details, including how to report abuse.

## Issues - Searching and Creating
Before you create a new issue, search [open issues](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues/) to make sure there isn't an existing issue tracking work related to the issue you're trying to resolve. If there is, feel free to contribute to the existing discussion. If there isn't an issue, create one and add an outline for the article you want to create, or explain the issue and resolution for existing content. When possible, fill out as much information as possible requested in the Issue Template. Pull requests are welcome without issue creation. If you can fix a docs issue with a pull request, go for it. There's no need to submit a corresponding issue.

### Titles and Descriptions
When creating issues, add a clear title and description. Issues should contain relevant information e.g., the document title, the information that is incorrect or outdated and your suggestion on how to fix it, reasons why method A is better than method B, and so on.

**Example**:
Title: Apache Solr doc - Terminus command is not working
Description:

```
Re: [Awesome doc with an issue](https://pantheon.io/docs/)

Priority: Medium

## Issue Description
The document currently suggests using `XYZ` commands, but I get the following error (insert error message).

## Suggested Resolution
The fix is to use `ABC` commands.
```

## Edit and Test Locally
See [Local Installation](<README.md#local-installation>) for details.

Branch names should start with the corresponding issue number followed by a brief description. If no issues exists, [you can create one](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues/new?title=New%20Doc%20Proposal%20&body=Priority%20(Low%E2%80%9A%20Medium%E2%80%9A%20High)%3A%0A%0A%23%23%20Title%0A%0A%0A%23%23%20Description%0A%0A%0A%23%23%20Outline%0A%0A%0A%23%23%20Expected%20Audience%0A%0A%0A%23%23%20Path%0A(e.g.%20%60source%2Fdocs%2Farticles%2Fsites%2Fcode%60%20or%20%60source%2Fdocs%2Farticles%2Fwordpress%60)&labels=new%20doc) first, or proceed without it. For example, `3830-add-branch-guidelines-to-contributing-md`.

### Updating Header and Subheaders
Headers and Subheaders render as H2 and H3 tags when the site is published. These tags automatically generate anchors which can be relatively linked throughout the site. When creating or editing, avoid using numbers and special characters.

## Edit on GitHub
Trying to edit or create a file in this repository will create your fork automatically. Commit changes and issue pull-requests one document/issue at a time. For more information, see [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Keep your Local Updated with Master
From your local repo, run the following commands in order:
1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull --rebase upstream master`

## Add a New Doc

### Front Matter
All of our documentation is generated from markdown files, found at [`source/content/`](/source/content/) and [`source/content/guides/`](source/content/guides/). These markdown files must have front matter that allow the page to render successfully. This is required if you plan to create a new doc. Here's an example:

```
---
title: Git FAQs
description: Answers to commonly asked questions about Git, Drupal 7, Drupal 6 and Pantheon.
contributors: [mrfelton]
---
```
