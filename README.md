Usage
-----

#### 0. Get the code.
Fork and clone this repository. Issue pull-requests one document at a time.

### Running Locally

#### 1. Get composer.

If you don't already have it, you can install it quickly:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
If you need to install it globally, 
```
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
#### 2. Install dependencies:

From within the `documentation` repo, run composer install

```
composer install
```

That will download all your dependencies and set up sculpin.

#### 3. Start local server:

Build sculpin and run a local instance:


```
./vendor/bin/sculpin generate --server
```
You can now visit your docs site at <http://localhost:8000/docs>


Finally, you can tell sculpin to watch the docs directory and automatically
regenerate anything changed:

```
./vendor/bin/sculpin generate --server --watch
```

 

If you use --watch and see it constantly running, regenerating, drop --watch
until you identify and resolve the problem.

Images won't show up locally unless you apply these commands:
```
$ cd output_dev
$ ln -s ./ source
```
