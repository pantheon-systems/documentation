Usage
-----

#### 1. Get the code:
Fork and clone this repository. Issue pull-requests one document at a time.

### Running Locally

#### 2. Get composer:
If you do not wish to install composer globally, please refer to [getcomposer.org instuctions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

Run the following command to install composer globally:
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
**Note**: Run the `mv` command with sudo if it fails.
#### 3. Install dependencies:
From within the `documentation` repo, run the following command to install all needed dependencies:
```
composer install
```
#### 4. Install sculpin and start your local server:
If you do not want to install sculpin globally, you can use the following commands to start your local server:
```
./vendor/bin/sculpin generate --server
```

In order to globally execute sculpin, run the following commands:
```
curl -O https://download.sculpin.io/sculpin.phar
sudo chmod +x sculpin.phar
mv sculpin.phar sculpin
mv sculpin /usr/local/bin
```

Build sculpin and run a local instance:

```
sculpin generate --server
```
You can now visit your docs site at <http://localhost:8000/docs>


Finally, you can tell sculpin to watch the docs directory and automatically
regenerate anything changed:
```
sculpin generate --server --watch
```
If you use --watch and see it constantly running, regenerating, drop --watch
until you identify and resolve the problem.

#### 5. Images
For images to render on your local environment you need to apply these commands from within the `documentation` directory:
```
$ cd output_dev
$ ln -s ./ source
```
