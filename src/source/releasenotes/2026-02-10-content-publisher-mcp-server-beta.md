The [Content Publisher MCP Server](https://docs.content.pantheon.io/mcp) is now in Public Beta. This integration enables AI assistants and other agentic applications to interact directly with [Content Publisher](https://docs.content.pantheon.io), streamlining content workflows through natural language commands.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants and agentic applications to securely connect with external tools and data sources. With the Content Publisher MCP Server, content teams can manage their publishing workflows conversationally -- without leaving their AI assistant interface.

## What’s new?
* **Connect and manage documents** - Connect Google Docs to collections, disconnect documents, and transfer ownership.
* **Publish content** - Preview, publish, unpublish, and manage approval workflows. Manage all documents metadata.
* **Manage collections** - Create collections, manage collaborators, administrators and access control, administer webhooks as well as all collection configurations options.
* **Work with content model** - Manage metadata schemas.

## Example workflows
* "Create a Google Doc about our product launch and connect it to the Marketing collection, go through the preview, enrich and publish phase"
* "Update the description metadata for the Q1 report and publish it"
* "Add sarah@company.com as a collaborator on the Documentation collection"
* “Find all documents with Author set at “John Doe” and replace with “Jane Doe”

And really, any other content operation workflow you might think of!
