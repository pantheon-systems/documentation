The PHP Foundation officially considers [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) as End Of Life status as of December 31, 2025.

However, Pantheon includes LTS security coverage for all available PHP versions with [PHP Runtime Generation 2](/php-runtime-generation-2). This coverage is automatic and requires no further action. By providing LTS editions of older PHP versions, customers can safely operate their sites while working through upgrade plans to modern versions.

For the best performance and security, Pantheon recommends running PHP 8.2 and above.
