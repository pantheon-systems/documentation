Terminus [4.1.3](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.1.3) is now available. This release includes critical fixes for plugin installation issues affecting customer GitHub Actions workflows.

## Key improvements in this release

- **Fixed Composer security warnings blocking plugin installation**: Resolved issues where Composer security audit was preventing Terminus from installing plugins in GitHub Actions environments ([#2766](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2766))
- **Enhanced environment comparison**: Fixed logic to not rely on commit labels when comparing environments ([#2761](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2761))
- **Improved session validation**: Sessions are now considered active only if they're valid for more than 1 minute ([#2758](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2758))
- **Better error handling**: Added proper handling for cases where initialization status isn't returned ([#2760](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2760))
- **Enhanced logging**: All logger output messages now include timestamps for better debugging ([#2745](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2745))
