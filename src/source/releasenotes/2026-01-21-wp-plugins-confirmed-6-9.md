## Actively Maintained Plugins
The following plugins have been tested and verified for compatibility:

- [WP SAML Auth](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-saml-auth/)

## Action Required
We recommend updating your Pantheon plugins to their latest versions alongside your WordPress 6.9 core upgrade. This ensures you receive the latest performance optimizations, security patches, and full compatibility with PHP 8.4.

As a best practice, always test these updates in a Dev or Multidev environment before deploying to Live.
