## Key Changes

* Design improvements to align with the latest usability standards for increased consistency. 
* The previous Drupal migration process (which leveraged `drush ard`) led to failures for most users. The Drupal migration process has now been streamlined so that, when the site deployment is complete, users are instead prompted to migrate manually with crosslinks to respective docs for each step.
