The new Site Dashboard is now available for **all** Workspaces. Today's release switches Personal Workspaces over to the new experience, a change we recently completed for Professional Workspaces. 

The following ON/OFF toggles have been removed from the user interface: 
* **Personal Workspace** > **Site list** "Open sites in new beta" 
* **Professional Workspace** > **Site list** "Open sites in new beta" ([removed in a previous release](/release-notes/2025/11/new-site-dashboard-now-default-for-professional-workspaces))


<Alert title="Note" type="info">

The following highlights what users can expect in the new experience. Note these items have not been added or impacted by todays change but were delivered by our earlier [Beta release](/release-notes/2025/08/site-dashboard-beta#what-to-expect).

</Alert>


* **Same functionality, familiar workflows** – No need to relearn anything. Your day-to-day tasks remain unchanged.
* **Modern, accessible design** – We’ve made significant improvements to align with the latest usability design standards, enhancing readability, contrast, and navigation.
* **Performance improvements under the hood** – While this may feel mostly visual, we’ve reworked key infrastructure for long-term speed and reliability.
* **Small but powerful UX upgrades** – New conveniences like one-click to copy the commit SHA, along with other thoughtful touches for enhanced usability.
