### New Guides

Check out our new guide <strike>Automated Testing for WordPress with Behat</strike> to learn how to set up Behat on your local machine and run automated tests against a remote WordPress site. **Editors note:** This was replaced with [Automate Testing with Behat](/guides/behat).

In our new guide [Use Terminus to Create and Update Drupal Sites on Pantheon](/drupal-commandline), you'll learn how to create a new Drupal site, install some contrib modules, commit code, and clone from one site environment to another—all through the Terminus CLI.

Feel more at home at the command line? Read our [new guide](/guides/wp-cli) to learn how to use Terminus and WP-CLI to create and manage a WordPress site.
