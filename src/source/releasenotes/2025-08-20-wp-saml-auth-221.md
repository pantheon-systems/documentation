Pantheon has released a new version of our [WP SAML Auth WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-saml-auth/). This update focuses on modernizing PHP support and providing developers with more granular control over SAML configurations.

## What's New
- PHP 8.4 Compatibility: Full support for PHP 8.4 has been added.
- Updated PHP Requirements: The minimum supported PHP version has been increased to 7.4 to ensure better security and performance.
- WordPress 6.9 Compatibility: Confirmed compatibility with WordPress 6.9.
- Enhanced Configuration: Added the wp_saml_auth_internal_config filter, allowing developers to customize the OneLogin SAML configuration.
- SimpleSAMLphp 2.x Support: Improved auto-detection for SimpleSAMLphp 2.x and optimized autoloader discovery to skip redundant processes when the SimpleSAML\Auth\Simple class is already loaded.

## Bug Fixes
Settings Page Warnings: Fixed a warning message on the plugin's settings page that appeared for users not utilizing SimpleSAML.

## Important: Compatibility & Testing
While this update improves autoloader discovery, it changes how the plugin interacts with the local environment. We strongly recommend testing in a lower environment before upgrading if you use:

Non-Standard Installations: Custom SimpleSAMLphp installations located in non-standard directories.
Manual Autoloaders: Custom autoloader code that manually handles the loading of SimpleSAMLphp.

## Action required
You are encouraged to upgrade your version of WP SAML Auth to the latest version as soon as possible so you know with certainty whether your site is vulnerable. If you see the notice in your dashboard, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of [SimpleSAMLphp](https://simplesamlphp.org/) immediately.
