Terminus [4.1.4](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.1.4) is now available. This hotfix release adds PHP 8.5 support and resolves plugin installation issues.

## Key improvements in this release

- **PHP 8.5 support**: Terminus now supports PHP 8.5 ([#2769](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2769))
- **Fixed plugin installation issues**: Ensured the plugins `composer.json` file also disables audit block-insecure, resolving Composer security warnings that could block plugin installation ([#2772](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/pull/2772))
