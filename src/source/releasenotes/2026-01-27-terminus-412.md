Terminus [4.1.2](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.1.2) is now available. This patch update contains the latest bug fixes and improvements for this tool.

This release includes enhanced logging capabilities and improved session handling.

### Added
- Add timestamps to all logger output messages for better debugging and log analysis

### Fixed
- Consider a session active only if it's valid for more than 1 minute, improving session stability
- Handle cases where is_initialized doesn't return a value, preventing potential errors
- Do not rely on commit labels, instead compare commits between 2 environments for more accurate deployment detection

## How to upgrade Terminus
If you manage your installation via Homebrew on macOS, you can update Terminus with the following command:

```shell{promptUser: user}
brew upgrade pantheon-systems/external/terminus
```
For other systems, see additional upgrade instructions [here](/terminus/install).
