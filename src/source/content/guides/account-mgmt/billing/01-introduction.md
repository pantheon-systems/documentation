This guide covers billing periods, payment methods, managing invoices, and more.

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

This guide provides information for Self-serve accounts.  If you are an Enterprise account, see [Enterprise Billing Center](/guides/enterprise-billing-center).

</Alert>

The permission to update credit cards and view history is granted only to the role of **Site Owner**. You can see who is assigned this role by clicking **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Team** in the Site Dashboard or Professional Workspace. Other roles do not have access to the billing information described on this page.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If you need to assume site and billing ownership, the current Site Owner must [transfer ownership to you directly](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#change-site-ownership).
