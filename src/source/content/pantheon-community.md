At Pantheon, we know that the best work happens when people come together. Our community is where Pantheon customers share the solutions that actually work, swap insights from the trenches, and push what's possible with WordPress and Drupal. It's a space where ideas flourish, partnerships form, and knowledge flows freely. 

Whether you're optimizing performance, scaling your agency, tackling a complex build, or just looking for people who speak your language, you're in the right place.

## Who Can Join

At this time, access to our community is limited to Pantheon customers and partner agencies. 

## How to Join
Getting in is easy:

[Join the Community](https://pantheon.io/developer-community) → Fill out a quick form → Check your inbox for the invite

That's it. Takes about 30 seconds, and you're in!


## What's in it for me? 
In the new community, you’ll get:
* All Pantheon alpha and beta programs in one place 
* A dedicated `#product-feedback` channel that makes product feedback more transparent, so you can see what other customers are suggesting, join the conversation, and upvote the ideas that matter most to you.
* Early access to select programs, events, and quarterly product reviews with our Product leaders (exclusive to community members only)
* Topic-based channels so you can jump into conversations around the features, products, and interests that matter most to you
