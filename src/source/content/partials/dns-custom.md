Pantheon provides the values for your DNS records that are assigned with your DNS service provider when adding a custom domain to your site:

![DNS Recommendations](../../images/dashboard/new-dashboard/2024/_domainadded.png)

If you don't already own a domain name, register one with a third-party provider. Pantheon is not a domain registrar, but we've created documentation for several popular DNS managers:

<Accordion title="DNS Host-Specific Instructions" id="host-specific2" icon="info-sign">

<DNSProviderDocs />

</Accordion>

Connect your custom domain on the Site Dashboard, and point DNS at Pantheon to trigger [automated HTTPS provisioning](/guides/global-cdn/https).

For more details on connecting custom domains, see https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/domains/custom-domains
