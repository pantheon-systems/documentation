# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Edit existing docs using GitHub's inline markdown editor or clone your fork, edit locally, commit changes, and push to your fork
* [Submit a pull request][pr]

[pr]: https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Follow our [style guide][style].
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
* Build and test locally to make sure everything looks good. Refer to [README](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/blob/master/README.md) for instructions
