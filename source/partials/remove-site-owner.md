When a developer creates a site in a partner workspace, they automatically become the "Site Owner/User in Charge" until the business owner starts paying for the site and becomes the owner. Workspace admins cannot delete users from a workspace until the listed owner no longer owns any sites in the workspace.

The user account in question must [transfer ownership to another person in the workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams/#change-site-owner). Partner workspace admins cannot change ownership of sites. If the workspace is using SAML for single-sign on, you should be able to log-in as the user and make the necessary changes. Partners without SAML will need to [contact support](/guides/support/contact-support/) to request ownership change, which may take 24-48 hours. As a workaround, admins can download a backup of the site, import it as a new site, move the domain name from the original site to the imported site, and delete the original site(s).

For all sites, we recommend instructing users to change their passwords regularly, using two-factor authentication, restricting access with Change Management, and carefully planning who will create client sites in the workspace.
