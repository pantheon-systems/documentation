Note that modifying the `hosts` file usually requires administrative privileges from the OS.

The location of the `hosts` file varies depending on your operating system:

 - **MacOS / Linux:** `/etc/hosts`
 - **Windows:** `C:\\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`


1. Navigate to your `hosts` file.

1. Add the lines to your operating system's `hosts` file in the format below, replacing the IP addresses with those provided by Pantheon, and the domain example names with your own domains.

```none:title=hosts
203.0.113.10    example.com
203.0.113.20    www.example.com
```
