Drush only supports one install method; it requires that your Drupal site be built with Composer and that Drush be compatible and listed as a dependency. Consider the following information when determining which Drush version is best suited for your site:

* [Drupal 9 requires Drush 10](https://www.drush.org/latest/install/#drupal-compatibility) or higher.
Drush 10 is available with the [addition of the  `pantheon.yml` file](#configure-drush-version) displayed above, or for [site-local installation](#site-local-drush-usage). It requires Drupal 9 or higher, [Composer](/guides/composer/), and PHP 7.1 or higher.

* [Drush 9](https://docs.drush.org/en/9.x/) and Drush 10 only work on Drupal 8.4 to Drupal 9.

* [Drush 8](https://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/) Drush 8 is the only recommended version to use in your `pantheon.yml` file. It is compatible with Drupal 7.

* Drush 5 and Drush 7 are available on Pantheon if needed. However, both versions are listed as [unsupported](https://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/install/#drupal-compatibility) by the Drush maintainers, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

When running Drush locally, we highly recommend running Drush version 8.3.2 or higher.
