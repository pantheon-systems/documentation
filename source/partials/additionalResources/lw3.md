## Automate and Integrate with Quicksilver

This workshop offers an introduction to Quicksilver: Pantheon's tool for integrating and automating with anything.

With Quicksilver you can tap into any workflow on Pantheon. Learn how to automate config imports, sanitize cloned databases, and tell everyone on Slack when you deploy to live.
