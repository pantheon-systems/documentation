### Platform Considerations

Connections will change from time to time due to the containerized nature of the platform. For security reasons, using the `$_ENV` superglobal inside PHP applications is not supported. As an alternative, consider using a Bash script and Terminus connection. You can view an example in the [Create Secure Connection to MySQL using TLS](/guides/secure-development/ssh-tunnels#create-secure-connection-to-mysql-using-tls) documentation.
