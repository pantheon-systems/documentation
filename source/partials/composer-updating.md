  <p>As packages pulled by Composer are updated (along with their dependencies), version compatibility issues can pop up. Sometimes you may need to manually alter the version constraints on a given package within the <code>require</code> or <code>require-dev</code> section of <code>composer.json</code> in order to update packages. See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions" class="external">updating dependencies</a> section of Composer's documentation for more information.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As a first troubleshooting step, try running <code>composer update</code> to bring <code>composer.lock</code> up to date with the latest available packages (as constrained by the version requirements in <code>composer.json</code>).</p>
