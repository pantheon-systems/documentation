  Your code includes all custom and contributed modules or plugins, themes, and libraries. The codebase should not include the `sites/default/files` directory, or any other static assets you do not want tracked by version control.

1. Export the database and media files (`sites/default/files`) from the old platform, but do not add them or upload any files to Pantheon.
