<p>Partial Composer adoption for Drupal 8 sites is not supported since Composer is used by core, meaning any change to <code>composer.json</code> or the <code>vendor</code> directory would result in massive merge conflicts when trying to update core via one-click updates in the Pantheon Site Dashboard. Composer with Drupal 8 is an all or nothing proposition. To use Composer to manage Drupal 8 sites, use the <a href="/docs/guides/build-tools/">Build Tools</a> or <a href="/docs/guides/drupal-8-composer-no-ci/">Drupal 8 and Composer on Pantheon Without Continuous Integration</a> methods.</p></div>
