<h2>Authenticating</h2>
<h3>SSH Keys</h3>
<p>To take full advantage of Pantheon, you should load your public SSH key into your account. SSH keys are a best practice for authentication, allowing you more security than a simple password. You will only need to do this once, no matter how many sites you work on. For more details, see <a href="/docs/ssh-keys/">Generate and Add SSH Keys</a>.</p>
<h3>Dashboard Credentials</h3>
<p>If you are prompted for a password when connecting to the platform, use your <strong>Pantheon Dashboard</strong> login password to gain access.</p>

  <h4 class="info">Note</h4>
  <p markdown="1">If you login via social login (Connect with Google) or Single-Sign On (SSO) and you'd like to authenticate using a password, logout and visit <a href="https://dashboard.pantheon.io/reset-password" class="external">https://dashboard.pantheon.io/reset-password</a> to add a password to your account.</p>

<p>Larger agencies with multiple developers using password authentication who login frequently may see access issues across the organization. To avoid potential authentication failures, we strongly recommend using SSH keys.
