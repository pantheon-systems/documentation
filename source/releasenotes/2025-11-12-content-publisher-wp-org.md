We recommend that all customers switch their sites to the WordPress.org–hosted version to take advantage of seamless updates and improved long-term support. By switching, you’ll:

- **Receive automatic update notifications** and one-click upgrades within the WordPress admin panel  
- **Stay up to date** with the latest security, stability, and compatibility improvements  
- **Benefit from WordPress’s official distribution system**, including built-in changelogs, and version tracking  

Switching to the [repository version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-content-publisher/) helps ensure your site runs the most stable and officially supported release of the plugin.
