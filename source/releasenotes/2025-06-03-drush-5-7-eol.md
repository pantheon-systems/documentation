As part of our ongoing platform maintenance and security improvements, Drush versions 5 and 7 are no longer available on Pantheon. Sites currently configured to use Drush 5 or 7 are being automatically upgraded to Drush 8 over the next few days.

Drush 5 reached end-of-life (EOL) in May 2015 and Drush 7 in July 2017. EOL software does not receive security or feature updates, and could expose sites to attack if any vulnerabilities or exploits are discovered.

## Action required

While all sites previously using Drush 5 or 7 have been auto-upgraded to Drush 8, the [`pantheon.yml`](/pantheon-yml) file for these sites have not been changed and will still contain the retired values. In the future, this will cause a `git push` to the platform to be rejected. Customers with sites configured for Drush 5 or 7 should [upgrade the Drush version](/guides/drush) in `pantheon.yml` to at least Drush 8.

Sites created with custom upstreams using EOL Drush versions may also have unexpected behavior upon site creation. Upstream updates may also fail if pantheon.yml is updated while `drush_version` is still set to 5 or 7.
