### Notes

* [Support for HEIC images](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/automatic-conversion-of-heic-images-to-jpeg-in-wordpress-6-7/) -- added in this version of WordPress -- will not be supported at release time on Pantheon due to a conflict with our version of ImageMagick. We are working on a solution that will include support for HEIC images in a future platform update.
