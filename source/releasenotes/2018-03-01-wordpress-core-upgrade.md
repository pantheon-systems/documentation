[WordPress 4.9.5](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/) has been pushed to all WordPress site dashboards.

Pantheon's update to WordPress 4.9.5 included a customization to the WordPress login form, which shows a button to "Return to Pantheon" to help with the first time user experience. Additional information is available [here](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/issues/155).
