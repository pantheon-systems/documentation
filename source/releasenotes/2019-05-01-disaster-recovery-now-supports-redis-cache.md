Pantheon’s new [Disaster Recovery](https://pantheon.io/features/disaster-recovery) offering now supports Redis application cache. A standby Redis cache is provisioned in the site’s backup zone and ready for failover in the event of a data center outage. Also see documentation on [Redis and Disaster Recovery best practices](/multizone-failover#redis-and-multizone-failover-best-practices).
