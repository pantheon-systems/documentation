PHP 8.1 is now [recommended](https://docs.pantheon.io/php-versions) for Drupal sites version [9.3.0](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/php-requirements#versions) and higher. An underlying bug with ProxySQL was fixed in [version 2.4.3](https://proxysql.com/blog/releasing-proxysql-v2-4-3/) and PHP 8.1 was updated on the platform to incorporate this fix.
