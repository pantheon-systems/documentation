Pantheon has shared our roadmap with customers for a long time, but it was static and didn't allow you to submit feedback. With our new [self-serve public roadmap](https://roadmap.pantheon.io), that all changes.

## What's new? 

* Access our new self-serve public roadmap at your convenience.
* Submit feedback about individual features on the roadmap, or new ideas that aren't yet represented.

For more details, see [related documentation](/roadmap).

## We’d love your feedback
