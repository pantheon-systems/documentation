The open plugin architecture of Terminus allows developers to extend it’s functionality and [create new commands](/terminus/create). For a list of supported plugins, take a look at our new [Plugin Directory](/terminus/directory) in the docs.

#### Mass Updates
[The Mass Update plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-mass-update) applies all available upstream updates to a list of sites. This allows users who manage a lot of sites to easily stay on top of Drupal and WordPress core updates.

### Build Tools
[This Terminus plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin) contains a collection of six additional commands useful during the build step on a Pantheon site that uses a GitHub PR workflow.

#### Filer
[Terminus Filer](https://github.com/terminus-plugin-project/terminus-filer-plugin) is named as such because it’s an easy way to launch your SFTP client with all the connection details “filled” in.

#### Rsync
The [Terminus Rsync Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-rsync-plugin) makes it easy to copy files between your local computer and Pantheon. Once installed, you can use rsync as you normally would to transfer files, wrapped in Terminus commands.
