Tika 1.18 and 1.21 will no longer be available starting January 19, 2026. Impacted sites must upgrade to [Tika 3.2](https://tika.apache.org/3.2.0/index.html) which is available via [PHP Runtime Generation 2](/php-runtime-generation-2/).

The [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) toolkit detects and extracts metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries. On the Pantheon platform, our customers tend to use Tika to parse PDF content for searching with [Solr](/solr).

## Action Required

For most customers, we expect the upgrade to be seamless and not require any manual intervention. But if your site has a custom Tika integration, we recommend you follow [our documentation for upgrading to Tika 3](/external-libraries#apache-tika) as soon as possible to ensure your site continues to operate as expected.

Sites which have not upgraded to Tika 3 as of January 19, 2026, will be automatically upgraded. Setting `tika_version: 1` in `pantheon.yml` will be ignored after that date. Symlinks from the 1.xx jar filepaths (`/srv/bin/tika-app-1.xx.jar`) will point to the new Tika 3 jar (`/opt/pantheon/tika/tika.jar`). These symlinks will be removed later in 2026.
