Pantheon has updated our platform `robots.txt` file to include [Pope Tech](https://pope.tech/), a popular WCAG compliance scanning tool. This change allows crawling via Pope Tech User Agents on platform and custom domains for non-live environments (Dev, Test, and Multidevs). The functionality and contents of our platform `robots.txt` file are documented [here](/bots-and-indexing/#indexing-your-pantheon-site).
