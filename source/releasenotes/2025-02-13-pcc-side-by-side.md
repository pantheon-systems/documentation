Today we are releasing the **side-by-side preview editor** for Pantheon's Content Publisher. Previously available by request under a feature flag, the side-by-side preview editor is now available to all users participating in [the private beta program](https://pantheon.io/platform/content-publisher#beta).

This new experience makes it easy to see how content from Google Docs will render on your website:

![Preview Editor Example](https://cdn.prod.pcc.pantheon.io/bXl9A4Dif2o3vA4YetBQ/GGPWyzsBLg5rSNNLhTiD)

- Edit your Google Doc and see how it renders on your website in a single browser tab - no more juggling multiple windows.
- Get quick access to the preview directly from the content explorer in the administration interface.
- Toggle between ‘desktop’ and ‘mobile preview’ to check responsive rendering.
- Simply change the zoom factor for a better preview if your screen feels too small.


## What's next

- Further improvements to this feature as well as other bug fixes and minor improvements will be released continuously.
