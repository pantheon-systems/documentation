We introduced a new **side-by-side docs and website Preview Editor**. It is being rolled out progressively to users under a feature flag. If you use Content Publisher and don’t have access yet, contact us if interested to try it out.

This new experience makes it easy to see how content from Docs will render on your Website:

- Edit your Doc and see how it renders on your Website in a single browser tab—no more juggling multiple windows
- Get quick access to the preview directly from the content explorer in the administration interface (see below)
- Toggle between ‘desktop’ and ‘mobile preview’ to check responsive rendering
- Simply change the zoom factor for a better preview if your screen feels too small.
Adjustable pane widths
