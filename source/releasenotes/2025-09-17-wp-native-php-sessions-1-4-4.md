Pantheon has released a new version of our [Native PHP Sessions plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-native-php-sessions/). This release updates documentation and a number of minor dependencies under the hood. Most notably, this update tests the plugin against PHP 8.4, increases the minimum PHP version to 7.4 and bumps the minimum supported WordPress version to 5.3. Additionally, to comply with WordPress plugin repository guidelines, we have removed "WordPress" from the plugin name.

## Action required
You are encouraged to upgrade your version of Native PHP Sessions to the latest version as soon as you are able.

If you have issues with the plugin, [please use the GitHub issue queue for the plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-native-php-sessions/issues).
