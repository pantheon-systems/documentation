We’ve replaced all 5xx error messages with plain HTML and removed Pantheon branding for sites hosted on Pantheon. 

## Why this change

Many of our customers, particularly those who are clients of our agency partners, may not be aware that their sites are hosted on Pantheon. For these clients, encountering Pantheon branded error messages could lead to confusion.

## What’s changed

* Removal of Pantheon branding and Zeus graphic.
* Updated HTML to support the new messages.
