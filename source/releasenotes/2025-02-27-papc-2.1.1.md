The WordPress [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache) version [2.1.1](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/releases) update is now available. This latest update resolves a bug that caused some sites to cache 404 pages, leaving scheduled posts unavailable after publishing.

## What's new?

* A post's path is explicitly purged when it is published for the first time, in addition to related surrogate keys.
* Purged paths can be further customized with the `pantheon_clear_post_path` [filter](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache?tab=readme-ov-file#additional-purging-by-path).

Upgrade the plugin now in your WordPress admin to take advantage of these improvements and make the most of Pantheon's edge caching layer or [learn more about Pantheon Page Cache](/guides/wordpress-configurations/wordpress-cache-plugin) in our documentation.
