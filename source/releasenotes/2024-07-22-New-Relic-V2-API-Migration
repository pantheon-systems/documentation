On July 2, 2024, Pantheon completed the migration of our customer's New Relic accounts to begin using the New Relic v2 APIs:
* This allows Pantheon to leverage New Relic's latest account management features to manage its New Relic accounts. 
* We don't expect any customer impacts from this change other than better support of their Pantheon-managed New Relic accounts.
