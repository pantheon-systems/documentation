New sites created on the platform now use PHP Runtime Generation 2.

[PHP Runtime Generation 2](/php-runtime-generation-2) includes updated extensions, PHP 8.4 availability, and enhanced security features. This new PHP runtime [will begin rolling out to existing sites on September 17](/php-runtime-generation-2#timeline).

Some PHP extensions and OS packages have not been ported over to Generation 2 yet, and may never be ported. Review the [OS Packages and PHP Extensions documentation](/php-runtime-generation-2#os-packages) to review these changes. If your new sites depend on these, we recommend you [downgrade to Generation 1](/php-runtime-generation-2#q-can-i-switch-back-to-the-previous-php-runtime-if-i-encounter-issues) and contact your Customer Success Manager or create a support ticket to discuss your site needs.
