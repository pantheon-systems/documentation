Terminus 1.0 alpha was released to everyone who registered to help us with testing. Weâ€™d love you to test Terminus 1.0 alpha as well and/or share the release with experienced Terminus users who may not have signed up to test! To install, follow the instructions in the [Terminus Guide](/terminus/install). The manual addresses many questions about this release, but if you have ideas for how to improve the documentation or find things that are missing or unclear, please click "Contribute" at the top left of the doc and then "Report doc issue".
