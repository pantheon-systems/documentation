The WordPress Native PHP Sessions plugin added primary keys to its custom tables in 1.2.2 for greater performance and redundancy, but did not upgrade existing sites. Now, version 1.4 includes an optional upgrade command for sites that installed the plugin prior to the 1.2.2 release.

Our open source [WordPress Native PHP Sessions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-native-php-sessions/) is available in the WordPress.org plugins repo.
