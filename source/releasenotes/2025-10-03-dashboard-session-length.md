title: Pantheon Dashboard session length reduced to 14 hours
published_date: "2025-10-03"

Starting today all Pantheon Dashboard users will be required to log in after 14 hours - regardless of session activity. Terminus sessions are not impacted. See [related documentation](/faq#pantheon-user-account-login-session-length) for more information.

## Key Changes
* Previously, Pantheon Dashboard sessions expired after 24 hours of inactivity.
* Previously, session lengths were inconsistent in some places of the Pantheon Dashboard leading to random logout and authentication requests.
* Reducing session lengths to 14 hours provides various security benefits and stronger protection for your accounts.
