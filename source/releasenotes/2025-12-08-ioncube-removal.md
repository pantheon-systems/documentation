We are removing [ionCube](https://www.ioncube.com/) support from the platform on March 8, 2026. This PHP extension was prevously only available for PHP 8.1 on PHP Runtime Generation 1.

Pantheon continually reviews our PHP runtime and explores opportunities to optimize performance and build times.

If your application uses ionCube, please [contact support](https://pantheon.io/support) or your Customer Success Manager to explore options for your use case.
