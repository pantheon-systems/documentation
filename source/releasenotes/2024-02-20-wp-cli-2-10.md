We're thrilled to announce the availability of WP-CLI v2.10.0 on the Pantheon platform.

WP-CLI is easily accessible for any WordPress site on Pantheon through our CLI, [Terminus](/terminus). Manage your WordPress installations efficiently with the power of WP-CLI at your fingertips.

<h3>Highlights</h3>

* **New i18n "make-php" command:**
This new command lets site owners take advantage of WordPress Core's "Performant Translations" project even before it is released with WordPress Core.
* **Adds minor and patch limitations to theme updates:**
Now, like plugins, themes can be updated only to their latest minor or patch releases
* **Bug fixes:**
WP-CLI 2.10.0 fixes "a lot of small and not so small bugs" with more than 200 pull requests merged.
