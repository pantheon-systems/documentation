Terminus [4.0.3](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.0.3) is now available. This small update contains the latest bug fixes and improvements for this tool.

### Added
* Make site label available in `site:list` and `org:site:list` commands
* Add a debug log message to `workflow:wait` printing the workflow start time

### Fixed
* Regression affecting SSH commands (e.g., `drush`, `wp-cli`) on [sites using external version control](/github-application)
* Un-deprecated `--tags` parameter on `org:site:list` command
* Remove unnecessary api call from `tag:add` and `tag:list` causing unnecessary load and timeouts
