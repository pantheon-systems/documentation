A new beta experience for a freshly modernized Site Dashboard is rolling out across the platform starting now and will be available to all users over the coming weeks. [Sign up now to skip the wait!](https://forms.gle/jzERvoCUzD7U7iqs7)

### Enable the new beta experience 

Once rolled out, users will be prompted to toggle this new beta experience from the site list of a given Workspace:  

![Shows a site list for a professional workspace, with a banner at the top to toggle the new beta experienec off/on for site dashboards](../images/release-notes/toggle-beta-dash-banner.png)

When the toggle is “on,” the new beta experience of the site dashboard will be enabled. All site dashboards opened from this view will use the new beta experience.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Please note the toggle setting is specific to each user. If multiple users have access to the workspace, the toggle’s setting (on /off) will NOT impact others. 

</Alert>

### What to expect 

* **Same functionality, familiar workflows** – No need to relearn anything. Your day-to-day tasks remain unchanged.
* **Modern, accessible design** – We’ve made significant improvements to align with the latest usability design standards, enhancing readability, contrast, and navigation.
* **Performance improvements under the hood** – While this beta may feel mostly visual, we’ve reworked key infrastructure for long-term speed and reliability.
* **Small but powerful UX upgrades** – New conveniences like one-click to copy the commit SHA, along with other thoughtful touches for enhanced usability.
