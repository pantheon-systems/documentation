The most advanced content delivery network for Drupal and WordPress is now integrated directly into Pantheon. We've partnered with Fastly to deliver traffic across their edge cloud platform, and we've integrated Let's Encrypt to provide HTTPS free to all sites on our platform. This means sites on Pantheon will run even faster, content will be delivered even closer to users, and HTTPS on Pantheon is now automatic and free—forever.
