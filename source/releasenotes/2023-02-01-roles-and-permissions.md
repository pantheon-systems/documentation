Enhancements to the Workspace dashboard allow admins greater visibility and control over user roles, access levels, and privileges. Now, admins can perform periodic audits of users and permissions by Site or Workspace, communicate development work to specific users by Site group, and quickly onboard and offboard users at the Workspace and Site level. To learn more about roles and permissions, refer to our [documentation](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams).
