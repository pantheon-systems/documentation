[Terminus 2.0](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus) is the first major release of Terminus in over two years. New features let you list and change site plan level, and progress bars help you track the progress of your jobs. With this release we've also announced an [EOL schedule](/terminus/updates/#eol-timeline) for older versions of Terminus.
