Sometimes you just need more memory to serve your site reliably. To learn more about why we doubled the memory for most site plans, [check out this blog](https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-increases-php-memory-limits-performance-and-elite-plans) by Rachel Whitton, Lead Technical Writer here at Pantheon.

To take advantage of the increased memory limit, [contact our customer support team](/guides/support/contact-support/). Or drop by our [regular Zoom-based office hours](http://pantheon.io/developer-community/office-hours).
