### New Guides

Check out our new guide <strike>Automated Testing for WordPress with Behat</strike> to learn how to set up Behat on your local machine and run automated tests against a remote WordPress site. **Editors note:** This was replaced with [Automate Testing with Behat](/guides/behat).

In our new guide [Use Terminus to Create and Update Drupal Sites on Pantheon](/guides/terminus-drupal-site-management), you'll learn how to create a new Drupal site, install some contrib modules, commit code, and clone from one site environment to anotherâ€”all through the Terminus CLI.

Feel more at home at the command line? Read our [new guide](/guides/wp-cli) to learn how to use Terminus and WP-CLI to create and manage a WordPress site.
