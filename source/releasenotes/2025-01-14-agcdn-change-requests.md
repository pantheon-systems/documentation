### What's new

Pantheon Advanced Global CDN customers can now visit the **Edge** tab of the Pantheon dashboard, where a new **Change Request Form** is available. This feature streamlines the process of submitting requests for updates and changes to the Advanced Global CDN configuration, providing users with an interface for managing their Advanced Global CDN needs.

### Why is this being done?

Previously, the Advanced Global CDN service lacked a dedicated category within the Support dashboard. This could result in delays and inefficiencies when processing requests, as critical details were often missing or had to be clarified through additional communication. The new Change Request Form is designed to collect all necessary details upfront.

### How to get started

1. Navigate to the Pantheon dashboard and click on the **Edge** tab.  
2. Locate the new **Change Request Form** section.  
3. Complete the form with all relevant details about your request.  
4. Submit your request.

### Questions?
