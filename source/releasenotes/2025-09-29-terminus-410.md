Terminus [4.1.0](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.1.0) is now available. This minor update contains the latest bug fixes and improvements for this tool.
This release includes enhanced environment information visibility and improved error messaging.

- **Added PHP Runtime Generation and PHP Version fields** to the `env:list` command output, providing better visibility into your environment's PHP configuration
- **Improved workflow timeout handling** that now displays warnings instead of confusing error messages when workflows take longer than expected
