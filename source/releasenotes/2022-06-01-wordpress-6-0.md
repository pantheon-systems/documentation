[WordPress 6.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/) is the latest major release of WordPress and is currently available on the Pantheon platform. This release features nearly a thousand enhancements and bug fixes.

If you’ve updated the previously released Twenty Twenty-two theme outside of Pantheon's WordPress upstream, updating to WordPress 6.0 will result in an error, due to the [removal](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/53286) of the `wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/assets/fonts/LICENSE.md` file. To resolve this error delete this file, commit, and push your change, then reapply the update. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](https://docs.pantheon.io/core-updates).
