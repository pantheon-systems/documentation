[Drupal 8.3.4](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.3.4), [Drupal 7.56](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.56), and [WordPress 4.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/) have been pushed to all Site Dashboards.

[Drupal 8.3.3 and above hooks into the Pantheon service provider](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/186), to support operations such as clearing Pantheonâ€™s edge cache when Drupal cache is rebuilt.
