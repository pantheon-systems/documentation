Starting today, Pantheon will begin rolling out a new live chat support experience which unifies our backend infrastructures for [Live Chats](/guides/support/contact-support/#live-chat) and [Support Tickets](/guides/support/contact-support/#general-support-ticket).

## Key Benefits

* **Faster support:** Combining the backends for tickets and chats means quicker routing and less waiting.
* **Improved consistency:** Support engineers now have stronger context and continuity for conversations across chat and ticket histories.
* **Easier follow-ups**: Automatic email summaries and updates for users, even after live chat ends - so you can track issues and their progress at a high level.

## What to Expect During the Transition

**Note:** This change is being rolled out incrementally by workspace over the next few weeks. Not all workspaces will have access as of the publishing of this release note.

* **No interruptions:** Users will not experience any interruption in accessing live chat support during this transition.
* **Chat history:** All chats from the last 30 days prior to the transition will be moved to tickets, accessible from the Support tab of your [Personal Workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces#manage-workspaces).
