Starting today, Pantheon will begin rolling out a new Live Chat support experience which unifies our backend infrastructures for Live Chats and Support Tickets. This change is being rolled out incrementally by workspace over the next few weeks. Not all workspaces will have access as of the publishing of this release note.

## Whatâ€™s new? 

* **Faster support:** combining the backends for tickets and chats means quicker routing and less waiting 
* **Increased visibility:** chats are now auto converted to tickets and visible to all members of the workspace 

**Note:** Chat history will reset once your workspace is switched to the new experience, however all chats going forward are preserved as 1) conversations in the new Live Chat widget and 2) tickets in the Support tab of your workspace.
