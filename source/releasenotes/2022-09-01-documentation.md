[Advanced Global CDN](/guides/agcdn) - AGCDN is now in General Availability and allows for advanced site management, enhanced security, and custom WAF. You can review the [AGCDN case study](https://pantheon.io/blog/fight-cyberattacks-advanced-global-cdn) for a real-life example of an AGCDN implementation.

[Create a Composer-managed WordPress Site with Bedrock](/guides/wordpress-composer/wordpress-composer-managed) - WordPress does not natively support [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), however, [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) is a WordPress-specific framework for using Composer on WordPress sites. You can create a site based on the Pantheon-maintained [WordPress Composer Managed](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/wordpress-composer-managed) upstream. Bedrock installs WordPress as a required package so updates can be managed by Composer. The WordPress Composer Managed upstream is available for [Early Access](https://docs.pantheon.io/oss-support-levels#early-access) participants. Learn more about [Bedrock and Composer-managed WordPress sites](/guides/wordpress-composer/wordpress-composer-managed#more-resources).

[Environment Configuration](/guides/environment-configuration) - Learn about [environment configurations](/guides/environment-configuration#code-and-configuration-in-separate-environments) on Pantheon in our new accessible guide. Each site on Pantheon comes with three environments: Dev, Test, and Live. This allows you to develop and test features without impacting your Live site. Additional development environments are available with [Multidev](/guides/multidev). Refer to the [Pantheon WebOps Workflow](/pantheon-workflow) documentation for more details.
