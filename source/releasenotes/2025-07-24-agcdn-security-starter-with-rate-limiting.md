Today we are announcing a new Advanced Global CDN (AGCDN) package that adds Rate Limiting to our Security Starter package. Previously, in order to leverage customized rate limiting capabilities, a higher-tiered AGCDN package was required (Advanced Global CDN with WAF/IO). The [**Security Starter with Rate Limiting**](/guides/agcdn#security-starter-with-rate-limiting) package comes as a response to customer feedback, where rate limiting alone did not justify the requirements (or cost) for the full [Advanced Global CDN with WAF/IO](/guides/agcdn#advanced-global-cdn-with-wafio) package.

To review all available Advanced Global CDN packages and compare available features, see [related documentation](/guides/agcdn).

Reach out to your account manager to add AGCDN to your contract. If you don't have an account manager, you can [contact sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us).
