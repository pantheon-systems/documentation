Today we are releasing v1.0 of [Pantheon Content Publisher's Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_content_publisher) - a new contrib module for Drupal sites. This new module replaces [the previous module](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pcc-drupal-module) that was used by earlier participants of [the private beta program](https://pantheon.io/platform/content-publisher?_gl=1*pi6niv*_gcl_au*Mjc4NDY3NTIzLjE3NDQ4OTk4NDY.*_ga*ODM4NjY0NDYwLjE3NDQ4OTk4NDc.*_ga_CPJLBDH983*MTc0NDkwMzA3OS4yLjEuMTc0NDkwMzEwNi4wLjAuMA..).


## What's new?

This release marks a complete redesign of the Drupal integration for Content Publisher, and offers new functionality: 

* Manages content as standard Drupal entities, rather than relying on Drupal Views for rendering.
* Metadata fields are now converted into standard Drupal configured fields.
* Search API support has been added, allowing Content Publisher content to be searched by Drupal with blended results alongside other Drupal content.
* Smart Components from Google Docs get represented as fieldable Drupal entities.
* Increased reliability for real-time previews.
* Improved configuration panel.
