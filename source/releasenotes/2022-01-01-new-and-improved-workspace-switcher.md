The usability of Workspace Switcher in the New Dashboard has been improved. The switcher in the Primary Global Navigation is now optimized for large accounts and will allow users to search for a Workspace directly in the New Dashboard. You can view up to 10 Workspaces connected to your account, from the list in the Primary Global Navigation.
