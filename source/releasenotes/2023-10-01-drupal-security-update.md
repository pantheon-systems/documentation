On September 20th, [Drupal core updates were released to address a critical vulnerability in the JSON:API module](https://status.pantheon.io/incidents/vj842n7k7w40). Those updates became immediately available within the Pantheon dashboard for one-click code updates. Additionally, [our engineers updated our CDN to mitigate potential attacks](https://status.pantheon.io/incidents/598zxv2v8l7p).

If you have a Drupal site using JSON:API we suggest you update as soon as possible if you haven't done so already. And even if you aren't using JSON:API, it'll still feel good to apply an update, right? To better understand the nature of security updates, [come watch the Pantheon YouTube Livestream on October 25th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV2ZSeBOziU).
