Pantheon is entering beta for our modernized site dashboard experience.
Beta access is rolling out to all users over the coming weeks. <br><br>
**Sign up to get early access:** https://forms.gle/jzERvoCUzD7U7iqs7

### How to get started

When beta access is enabled, a new toggle will appear on the Site List page.

When the toggle is “on,” the site dashboard beta will be enabled. All sites that a user has access to in that workspace will open in the new beta experience when their name is clicked in the site list. 
Please note the toggle setting is specific to each user. If multiple users have access to the workspace, the toggle’s setting (on /off) will NOT impact others. 

### What to expect <br>

✅ Same functionality, familiar workflows – No need to relearn anything. Your day-to-day tasks remain unchanged. <br>
✅ Modern, accessible design – We’ve made significant improvements to align with the latest usability design standards, enhancing readability, contrast, and navigation. <br>
✅ Performance improvements under the hood – While this beta may feel mostly visual, we’ve reworked key infrastructure for long-term speed and reliability. <br>
✅ Small but powerful UX upgrades – New conveniences like one-click to copy the commit SHA, along with other thoughtful touches for enhanced usability.

### Other details <br>
* Sections in progress – A few parts of the dashboard are still in development and will roll out over the course of the beta program. <br>
* Easily switch back – If you need to, you still have access to the current dashboard. <br>
* Share feedback – We have a dedicated Slack channel for beta participants where you can easily ask questions and discuss feedback with the Pantheon product and engineering team.
