Effective May 1, 2024, Pantheon began to enforce a monthly limit of synthetics checks for each Pantheon account (excluding ping checks).
* Each Pantheon account can run up to 10,000 New Relic synthetic checks per month (unlimited number of ping checks).
* Pantheon provides a monthly shared number of synthetic checks for all Pantheon customers.
* To ensure that all Pantheon users can use Synthetics, we ask customers to reduce their checks to <10,000 per month per Pantheon account.
* After May 1, 2024, Pantheon will take action by reducing the number of synthetic checks in Pantheon accounts exceeding 10,000 checks per month.
* Pantheon will not delete synthetic monitors or historical data but will reduce the frequency and the number of locations where a synthetics monitor orginates from.
