Effective October 22, 2025 the Unprivileged user role will be renamed to Contributor. The Contributor role will be granted limited access to Workspaces. This update is to ensure that all Pantheon users have access to the modern dashboard experience.

The primary changes are
* The name will change from Unprivileged to Contributor in the dashboard and documentation.
* Contributors will be able to access a limited set of screens and functionality in Workspaces. 
* They will not be able to perform additional administrative, billing, or site functionality.

Users assigned this role will retain access solely to the sites for which they have been explicitly granted permission. They will not be authorized to modify Workspace configurations, access billing information, create custom upstreams, or perform other administrative functions. If these users are in multiple Workspaces, they will continue to have access to the Workspace Selector to change which Workspace they are currently working in.
