Pantheon Advanced Page Cache v1.5.0 is now available on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/releases/tag/1.5.0). This release adds a new filter to make cache purges less aggressive and provide more flexibility for developers and the sites they maintain. You can learn about the filter in the plugin's [README file](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache?tab=readme-ov-file#ignoring-specific-post-types) which includes an example of how to use it.

Additionally, this update implements our recently updated [WPUnit Helpers](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wpunit-helpers) project to simplify PHP Unit tests as well as our recently developed [Plugin Release Actions](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/plugin-release-actions) to automate steps in the release process.

You can read the full changelog in the [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/releases/tag/1.5.0).
