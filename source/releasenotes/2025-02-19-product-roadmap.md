Pantheon has shared our roadmap with customers for a long time, but it was static and didn't allow you to submit feedback. With our new [interactive public roadmap](https://roadmap.pantheon.io), that all changes.

## What's new? 

* Access our new interactive public roadmap at your convenience.
* Submit feedback about individual features on the roadmap, or new ideas that aren't yet represented.

For more details, see [related documentation](/roadmap).

## Why is this being done?
In the past, Pantheon’s roadmap was shared via presentations a few times a year. Our hands-on approach with customers isn’t going away, but we wanted to ensure our product roadmap was available to all customers, whenever they needed it. Our prior method also didn’t provide a clear path for feedback, which is now built into the new experience.

## What’s next?
Access the roadmap anytime at [https://roadmap.pantheon.io](https://roadmap.pantheon.io). Submit feedback about roadmap items or new ideas that you’d like to see. Help drive the future of Pantheon, ensuring our platform grows with you and continues to meet your needs.
