Today we are making a new GitHub Application for direct integration with Pantheon available as a private Beta. [Let us know here if you would like access to this GitHub Application turned on for your Pantheon workspace.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0vYrRbPQBxR-hT8kGJ4bEdYPtpkTtfDvPM89xD2dNZeqLqA/viewform)

Similar to our [recently released *Action*](/release-notes/2025/05/github-action)*,* this GitHub *Application* also moves code to Pantheon Multidev environments and the Dev environment to correspond to changes made to a repo on GitHub.

This Application is intended for teams that want the simplest possible tool for achieving the above workflow. Once it is turned on, no additional configuration is necessary.

The GitHub *Action* is intended for teams who want to make customization to their workflows and treat the deployment of code as one step in a larger Continuous Integration workflow.
