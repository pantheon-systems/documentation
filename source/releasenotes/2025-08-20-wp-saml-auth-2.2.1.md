Pantheon has released a new version of our [WP SAML Auth WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-saml-auth/). This release updates the notification for a recently discovered vulnerability for those using the [SimpleSAMLphp library](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-46r4-f8gj-xg56). 

## Action required
You are encouraged to upgrade your version of WP SAML Auth to the latest version as soon as possible so you know with certainty whether your site is vulnerable. If you see the notice in your dashboard, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of [SimpleSAMLphp](https://simplesamlphp.org/) immediately.

If you have questions or concerns, [please open issues in the queue for the plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-saml-auth).
