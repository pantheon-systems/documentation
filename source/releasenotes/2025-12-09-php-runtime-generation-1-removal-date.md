Following the successfull rollout of [PHP Runtime Generation 2](https://docs.pantheon.io/php-runtime-generation-2) for all environments that have not opted-out, we are now preparing to remove PHP Runtime Generation 1 from the platform starting April 6, 2026.

Between April 6 and April 17, 2026, all environments that have not been upgraded will be auto-upgraded to Generation 2. Opting out will no longer be available.

Please view the [Known Changes and Requirements](https://docs.pantheon.io/php-runtime-generation-2#known-changes-and-requirements) list if you are still in the process of upgrading your site. We recommend all site owners proactively test and upgrade to Generation 2 rather than waiting for this auto-upgrade.
