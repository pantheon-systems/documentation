The Solr Search for WordPress plugin [v2.6.0]((https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power/releases)) update is now available. This latest update resolves a bug with custom solr schema on Composer-managed WordPress sites.

## What's new?

* Adds a new `is_solr_query` filter
* Fixes the default custom schema file path for Composer-managed and other non-standard uploads directories.
* Adds a new `solr_power_customer_schema_file_path` filter to set an alternative path for the custom schema file.

Upgrade the plugin now to take advantage of these improvements and fixes.
