## Key Changes
* The process and workflow is the same, with fewer “loading” screens.
* Design improvements to align with the latest usability standards.
* Previously, errors were checked after form submission. Now, errors are checked as you type.
* Previously, after deployment completed, only a single button was shown for opening the new site dashboard. In the new experience, we've added next steps in context with relevant documentation links:
