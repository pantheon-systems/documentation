[Pantheon Decoupled](/guides/decoupled/overview) - Pantheon Decoupled is available for Early Access participants. Pantheon Decoupled provides users with tools that improve the experience of building a decoupled front-end that sources data from a CMS back-end. With decoupled sites a CMS site can be linked to a single decoupled site or multiples sites, or the user does not need a CMS at all and can link directly to a front end application! Please check out how we can help you transition to a decoupled experience on the Pantheon platform.
