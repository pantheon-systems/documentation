<h3>What happened to 6.5.1?</h3>

**6.5.2** is the _first_ minor release for WordPress 6.5 rather than 6.5.1. Yesterday, it was [disclosed on the Make WordPress Core development site](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/04/09/what-happened-to-wordpress-6-5-1/) that due to an error with the initial package, 6.5.1 could not be released.

Upgrade to WordPress 6.5.2 right from your Pantheon dashboard or Terminus for added security.
