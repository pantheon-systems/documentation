[ClamAV](https://docs.pantheon.io/clamav) support is now operational with [PHP Runtime Generation 2](/php-runtime-generation-2). This open source antivirus engine helps protect endpoints by scanning uploads to your sites once configured via a module/plugin.

[PHP Runtime Generation 2](/php-runtime-generation-2) includes updated extensions, the latest PHP version, and enhanced security features. This new PHP runtime is currently available in beta and will begin rolling out on September 17. Early testing is recommended to ensure compatibility.
