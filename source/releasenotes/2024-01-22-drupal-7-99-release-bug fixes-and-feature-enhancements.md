Pantheon has seamlessly integrated the Drupal 7.99 release, packed with bug fixes and exciting feature enhancements. 

 <h3>Highlights</h3>

* **Menu link enhancement:** "Parent link" in new custom menu creation is now limited to the current menu, simplifying the process. Editing still allows access to links from other menus, enabling easy relocation.

* **New Drupal 7 hook:** Introduced a new “**hook_field_schema_alter()**”, providing additional flexibility for schema alterations.

* **Security improvement for failed logins:** Error messages after a failed login now include a password reset link without disclosing the username, enhancing security by preventing unintended disclosure to third-party services.

Elevate your Drupal 7 experience by applying these updates directly from your Pantheon dashboard. If you would like to delve into specifics of this release, please explore on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.99).
