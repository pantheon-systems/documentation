Customers can now upgrade their site database and PHP by using the One-Click Upstream Update feature in the Site Dashboard or the command `Terminus upstream:updates:apply`. Pantheon makes it simple to keep your site database secure and performant. Sites using Custom Upstreams can easily upgrade to supported database versions by configuring the site's `pantheon.yml`.
