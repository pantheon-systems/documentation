A few months ago we [added an RSS feed](release-notes/2024/07/rss-feed) to Pantheon release notes, and today we're improving the reliability of that experience. Previously, RSS readers would not pick up new release note entries if more than one was published on the same day. This bug is now fixed, ensuring a more reliable notification experience.
