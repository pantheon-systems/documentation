New Relic's APM Availability Monitoring has [known incompatibilities](/guides/new-relic) with SNI, which our HTTPS uses. Instead, we recommend configuring the free availability monitoring service within New Relicâ€™s Synthetics Lite tool. For details, refer to [New Relic APM Pro](/guides/new-relic/).
