We released an update for the [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/) WordPress plugin which adds a filter to allow disabling surrogate keys for posts' taxonomy terms. This can be especially helpful for posts with large numbers of taxonomies (such as WooCommerce products with a large number of global attributes).

For more information, see [Pantheon documentation](/guides/wordpress-configurations/plugins#disable-surrogate-keys-for-taxonomy-terms).
