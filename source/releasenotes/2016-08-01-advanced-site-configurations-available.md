Nested docroot: Serve sites from a `web` subdirectory, one-level beneath the root of your code repository. Among other use cases, this helps facilitate managing dependencies via Composer.
Protected Web Paths: Specify files or directories that you don’t want to be publicly web-accessible.
PHP Version: Now your site’s PHP version is managed via [pantheon.yml](/pantheon-yml) so it’s in version control and deployed along with the rest of your code.
