Some customers have reported that emails generated from form plugins, such as Gravity Forms or Contact Form 7, have content truncated after upgrading their site to PHP 8. A fix has been applied to PHP 8.2 and above. Affected sites can resolve this issue by [upgrading their PHP version](/guides/php/php-versions) to 8.2 or 8.3.

**Important PHP version information**

* PHP 8.0 reached End-of-Life on November 26, 2023.
* PHP 8.1 is now receiving security-only updates and will reach End-of-Life in December 2025. 

For the best performance and security, Pantheon recommends running PHP 8.2 and above.
