## Action Required: Default behavior of New Relic Drupal metrics has changed

Pantheon no longer supports Drupal-specific metrics in New Relic by default. However, the functionality is still available. If this is crucial for troubleshooting your sites, please add these lines to your siteâ€™s `pantheon.yml` file to enable this reporting:

```
new_relic:
  drupal_hooks: true
```

Our support team is happy to help if you have any questions or need assistance.
