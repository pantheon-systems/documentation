Starting today, the session length for users logged into the Pantheon Dashboard has been reduced from 24 hours to 14 hours - regardless of session activity.

## Key Changes
* Previously, Pantheon Dashboard sessions expired after 24 hours of inactivity.
* Previously, session lengths were inconsistent in some places of the Pantheon Dashboard leading to random logout and authentication requests.
* Reducing session lengths to 14 hours across the Pantheon Dashboard provides various security benefits and stronger protection for your accounts.

Terminus sessions are not impacted. See [related documentation](/faq#pantheon-user-account-login-session-length) for more information.
