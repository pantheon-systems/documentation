Starting today all Pantheon Dashboard and Terminus users will be required to log in after 14 hours of inactivity. Users are still forcibly logged out after 30 days as described in our [FAQ documentation](/faq#pantheon-user-account-login-session-length).

## Key Changes
* Previously, Pantheon sessions expired after 24 hours of inactivity but were inconsistent in some places leading to random logout and authentication requests.
* Reducing session lengths from 24 hours to 14 hours provides various security benefits and stronger protection for your accounts.
