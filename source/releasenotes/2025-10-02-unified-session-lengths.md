Starting today all Pantheon Dashboard and Terminus users will be required to log in after 14 hours - regardless of session activity. 

## Key Changes
* Previously, Pantheon sessions expired after 24 hours of **inactivity**, and users were otherwise forcibly logged out after 30 days. However, session lengths were inconsistent in some places leading to random logout and authentication requests.
* Reducing session lengths to 14 hours provides various security benefits and stronger protection for your accounts.
