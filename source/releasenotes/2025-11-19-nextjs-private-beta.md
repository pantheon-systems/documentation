Today, Pantheon's new solution for  Next.js  enters **Private Beta**. To request an invite, [submit this form](https://pantheon.io/nextjs-beta).

**Front-End Sites**, our previous offering for Next.js, will be discontinued. We encourage users to [migrate to the updated architecture](/nextjs/migrating-from-front-end-sites).

For more information, see [this related blog post](https://pantheon.io/blog/next-js-beta).


## What's new?
Some key changes for Next.js on Pantheon include:

* Improved runtime architecture, including [support for Pantheon's Global CDN](/nextjs/architecture).
* Site creation via [the command line](/nextjs/cli-tools) or [the dashboard](/nextjs/hello-world-tutorial#site-creation).
* Sites listed in your workspace alongside WordPress and Drupal, instead of a separate tab.
* Unified site dashboard design that's consistent with WordPress and Drupal user interfaces:
