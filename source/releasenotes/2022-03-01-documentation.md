[Convert an Empty Upstream Drupal Site to a Composer Managed Site](/guides/drupal-hosted-createempty-md) - Convert an empty upstream Drupal 9 site to use Composer to manage deployments and dependencies. You can then switch from `empty` to the new Integrated Composer `drupal-recommended` upstream while remaining on Drupal 9. To convert, ensure your site has the Pantheon [empty](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/empty) repository in its upstream. For more information, refer to our [documentation](/guides/drupal-hosted-createempty-md).

[Managing Drush Versions on Pantheon](/guides/drush/drush-versions#php-requirements) - Pantheon currently supports Drush versions 8, 10, and 11. For sites that are managed by Composer, a [site-local installation](/guides/drush/drush-versions#site-local-drush-usage) of Drush is recommended. To learn about Pantheon's default Drush version, compatibility, requirements, and how to implement site-local usage, refer to our [documentation](/guides/drush/drush-versions).
