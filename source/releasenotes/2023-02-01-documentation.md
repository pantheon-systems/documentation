Pantheon documentation now has a new location. Go to [docs.pantheon.io](https://docs.pantheon.io/) for information on all Pantheon products and features. The Pantheon docs site is deployed using [Front-End Sites](https://pantheon.io/features/decoupled-cms), with redirects from [pantheon.io](https://pantheon.io/) behind [AGCDN](https://pantheon.io/product/advanced-global-cdn). Ensure you check out our much quicker and improved docs site.
