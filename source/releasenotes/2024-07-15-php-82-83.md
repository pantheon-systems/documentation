PHP [8.2.21](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.2.21) and [8.3.9](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.3.9) were released on the platform. They contain the latest bug fixes for PHP.

As a reminder, PHP 8.0 reached End-of-Life and PHP 8.1 was moved to security-only updates on 26 November 2023. PHP 8.1 will reach End-of-Life in December 2025. For the best performance and security, Pantheon recommends running PHP 8.2 and above.
