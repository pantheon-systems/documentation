WordPress 6.5 will add a new [Font Library](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/14/new-feature-font-library/) feature. The Font Library allows you to upload fonts from your computer or add any of the fonts available on Google's font library to your WordPress site. In anticipation of this, Pantheon has added a feature to our [Pantheon MU Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-mu-plugin) to support the new Font Library feature. You can read more about the Font Library feature in our [guide to using the Font Library on Pantheon](/guides/wordpress-configurations/wordpress-font-library).
