[Pantheon's Long-Term Support (LTS) for Drupal 7](https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-and-tag1-support-drupal-7-websites) is now available. The default [Pantheon Drupal 7 upstream](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7) has been updated to include [the Tag1 Drupal 7 Extended Support (D7ES) module](https://www.drupal.org/project/tag1_d7es). This module is essential for leveraging our ongoing LTS offering.

### What's new

With this update, future LTS releases for Drupal 7 Core and the D7ES module will be provided through Pantheonâ€™s Drupal 7 upstream. For details, see our [Drupal 7 LTS documentation](/supported-drupal#d7-core-lts-and-platform-compatibility).

### Action required

To continue receiving security coverage for contributed modules:

* Apply the latest upstream update to your Drupal 7 site.
* Enable the Tag1 D7ES module in your environment and configure the email address for notifications.

### About Drupal 7 Long-Term Support

Pantheon has partnered with Tag1 Consulting to deliver security updates and maintenance for Drupal 7 sites for at least two years beyond the official end-of-life date on January 5, 2025. This extended support is included at no additional cost.
