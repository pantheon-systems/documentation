Today we are releasing v1.0 of [Pantheon Content Publisher](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_content_publisher) - a new contrib module for Drupal sites. This new module replaces [the older alpha module](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pcc-drupal-module) used by participants of [the private beta program](https://pantheon.io/platform/content-publisher?_gl=1*pi6niv*_gcl_au*Mjc4NDY3NTIzLjE3NDQ4OTk4NDY.*_ga*ODM4NjY0NDYwLjE3NDQ4OTk4NDc.*_ga_CPJLBDH983*MTc0NDkwMzA3OS4yLjEuMTc0NDkwMzEwNi4wLjAuMA..#beta). 

## What's new?

This release marks a complete redesign of the Drupal integration for Content Publisher, and offers new functionality: 

* Publishes content as standard Drupal entities, rather than relying on Drupal views for rendering
* Metadata fields are now standard Drupal configured fields
* Search support has been added, allowing content to be indexed and searchable by Drupal 
* Smart Components are now fieldable Drupal entities and no longer rely on Drupal SDC
* Increased reliability for real-time previews
* Improved configuration panel 

Thanks to this new module, Drupal developers considering Content Publisher are now able to use it in a native way, letting them choose their favorite Drupal development path and fully leverage the value of Drupal.

While this module is now available on drupal.org, it still requires access to a private beta program in order to be leveraged.
