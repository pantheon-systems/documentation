The Pantheon Front-End Sites Settings page is now available for users of the WordPress for Front-End project. It provides a simplified post install experience where users can copy environment variables for use in the Front-End Sites dashboard, and also test their preview endpoint. Instructions for creating a new WordPress project [can be found here](https://decoupledkit.pantheon.io/docs/backend-starters/decoupled-wordpress/creating-a-new-project).
