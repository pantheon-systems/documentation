[Cron for WordPress](/guides/wordpress-developer/wordpress-cron) - Pantheon Cron now runs WP-Cron as an hourly task or on demand using WP-CLI with Terminus. Using the WP-CLI to run cron jobs on WordPress sites improves overall site performance and reduces the processing overhead for scheduling requests. To learn more about Pantheon Cron, refer to our [documentation](//guides/wordpress-developerwordpress-cron).

[Edge Integrations](/guides/edge-integrations/) - Pantheon leverages integration between the CMS and our Global CDN with Edge Computing capabilities to deliver the right content to the right audience directly, and with fewer moving parts. Edge Integrations is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows users to personalize WordPress and Drupal on the Pantheon platform. For more information on Edge Integrations, refer to our [documentation](/guides/edge-integrations/).
