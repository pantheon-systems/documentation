PHP [8.2.23](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.2.23) and [8.3.11](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.3.11) were released on the platform. They contain the latest bug fixes and security updates for PHP.

Notably, these releases include a fix for [a bug](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/13817) that caused New Relic's PHP agent to crash on sites using the Font Awesome plugin.

As a reminder, PHP 8.0 reached End-of-Life and PHP 8.1 was moved to security-only updates on 26 November 2023. PHP 8.1 will reach End-of-Life in December 2025. For the best performance and security, Pantheon recommends running PHP 8.2 and above.
