With the latest [1.4.0 release](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-mu-plugin/releases) of the Pantheon MU Plugin, we have updated the default cache TTL to one week. Previously, the default value was `600` (10 minutes). This change is intended to improve the performance of your site by reducing the number of cache clears that are run automatically.
