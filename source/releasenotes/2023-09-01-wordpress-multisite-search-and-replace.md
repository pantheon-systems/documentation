WordPress Multisites can now run automated Search and Replace when cloning the database between environments or spinning up new environments.

Subdomain Multisites can use a domain map to define the URLs between environments, or auto-convert to a subdirectory Multisite in non-live environments.

For more information, see Pantheonâ€™s documentation on [Search and Replace](/guides/multisite/search-replace/). Or join the [#WordPress Slack Channel](http://slackin.pantheon.io) to connect with other Pantheon customers & super-users.
