The latest version of WordPress, [6.4.3](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/wordpress-6-4-3-maintenance-and-security-release/), became available on Pantheon as of January 30, 2024.

<h3>Highlights</h3>

* **Security updates:** Addressed two security vulnerabilities, including a PHP file upload bypass (limited to administrators), and a object injection mechanism that could be used to exploit an existing Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Since this release fixes security vulnerabilities, users are urged to upgrade their sites immediately. For a detailed analysis of the two security patches, see [this article from Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/articles/wordpress-6-4-3-security-release/).
