The [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) toolkit detects and extracts metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries. On the Pantheon platform, our customers tend to use Tika to parse PDF content for searching with [Solr](https://docs.pantheon.io/solr).

We recently announced [Tika 3.2 is now available](https://docs.pantheon.io/release-notes/2025/08/tika-3-2-available) on the platform. We are now planning to remove Tika 1.18 and 1.21 availability as of January 19, 2026.

For most customers, we expect the upgrade to be seamless and not require any manual intervention. But if your site has a custom Tika integration, we recommend you follow [our documentation for upgrading to Tika 3](https://docs.pantheon.io/external-libraries#apache-tika) as soon as possible to ensure your site continues to operate as expected.

Sites which have not upgraded to Tika 3 as of January 19, 2026, will be automatically upgraded. Symlinks from the 1.xx jar filepaths (`/srv/bin/tika-app-1.xx.jar`) will point to the new Tika 3 jar (`/opt/pantheon/tika/tika.jar`). These symlinks will be removed later in 2026.
