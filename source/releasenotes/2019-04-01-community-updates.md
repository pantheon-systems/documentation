Pantheon has launched our new [Community Forum](https://discuss.pantheon.io)!  In addition to the ephemeral and fast-moving Slack channel, the new forum gives the community a place for long-form discussions, problem-solving, and engagement.

Moving forward, weâ€™ll update you in this newsletter with the [hottest topics and discussions](https://discuss.pantheon.io/top) happening in the community.
