The _Site Traffic by Billing Period_ feature provides clear visibility into traffic usage across all your Pantheon sites, segmented by monthly traffic allotment. Whether you're managing a single site or an entire portfolio, you can now easily understand how traffic is allocated and consumed on a per-site basis. The visual of your traffic to the entitlement will reset at the end of your billing period.

## Key Benefits
* **Transparent Usage Insights:** See exactly how much traffic each site is using in relation to its plan or entitlement.
* **Simplified Billing Reconciliation:** Eliminate guesswork when matching traffic usage across multiple sites. 
* **Portfolio-Level Clarity:** For teams managing many sites, this view offers a clean roll-up and drill-down experience that makes it easier to manage resources.

This feature helps ensure you're always in control of your traffic and spending, and properly provision your sites month.

_Note - overages are still currently paused for all users. This change is to increase transparency into your traffic metrics and ensure sites are properly provisioned._
