As part of our ongoing platform maintenance and security improvements, Drush versions 5 and 7 will no longer be available on Pantheon starting May 13, 2025. After this date, sites using these versions will automatically be upgraded to Drush 8.

Drush 5 reached end-of-life (EOL) in May 2015 and Drush 7 in July 2017. EOL software does not receive security or feature updates, and could expose sites to attack if any vulnerabilities or exploits are discovered.

## Action Required

Sites using Drush 5 or 7 will need to [upgrade to Drush 8](/guides/drush/drush-versions#drupal-7) to maintain functionality and security:

1. Test your site with a newer version of Drush (8 or newer)
2. Update your site's Drush version
3. Review your deployment workflows and CI/CD pipelines to ensure compatibility with the new Drush version

On May 13, 2025, all sites using Drush 5 or 7 will be auto-upgraded to Drush 8.
