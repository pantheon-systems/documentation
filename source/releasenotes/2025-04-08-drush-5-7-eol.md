As part of our ongoing platform maintenance and security improvements, Drush versions 5 and 7 will reach end-of-life (EOL) on May 13, 2025. After this date, these versions will no longer be available for sites to use on the platform.

## Impact

Sites using Drush 5 or 7 will need to upgrade to a supported version to maintain functionality and security. Drush 8 and newer versions are recommended for all production sites.

## Action Required

If your site is using Drush 5 or 7, you should:

1. Test your site with a newer version of Drush (8 or newer)
2. Update your site's Drush version before May 13, 2025
3. Review your deployment workflows and CI/CD pipelines to ensure compatibility with the new Drush version

For guidance on upgrading Drush, please refer to our [Drush documentation](/guides/drush/).
