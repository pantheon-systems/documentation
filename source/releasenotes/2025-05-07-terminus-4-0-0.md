Terminus [4.0.0](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.0.0) is now available.
This release: 
1. adds support for PHP 8.4,
2. removes support for PHP versions 8.1 and below,
3. prompts the user for required command parameters when not otherwise provided.

Terminus 4 is compatible with PHP 8.2 and 8.3 (see [Supported Terminus and PHP versions](/terminus/supported-terminus)). The PHP version refers to the local machine on which Terminus itself runs (e.g. developers' own computers or containers for continuous integration). This is distinct from PHP versions that run websites on Pantheon's infrastructure (which still include support for PHP 7.x).

## How to upgrade to Terminus 4.x

If you use Homebrew (macOS-only) to manage your Terminus installation, you should upgrade using:

```shell{promptUser: user}
brew upgrade terminus
```


If you installed Terminus directly from the `.phar` file, you should upgrade using `self:update` command:
```shell{promptUser: user}
terminus self:update
```
