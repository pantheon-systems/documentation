## Support for older PHP versions in Terminus 3.x

Terminus 3.x is **not compatible with PHP 8.4**. The recommended PHP version to use locally with Terminus 3.x is 8.3. 

## How to upgrade to Terminus 4.x

If you previously used Homebrew (macOS-only) to manage your installation, you could upgrade using:

```shell{promptUser: user}
brew upgrade terminus
```


If you installed directly from the `.phar` file, you could upgrade using `self:update` command:
```shell{promptUser: user}
terminus self:update
```
