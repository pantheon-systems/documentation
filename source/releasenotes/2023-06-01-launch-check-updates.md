With [Launch Check](https://pantheon.io/features/launch-check?docs), Pantheon customers can find out in seconds the health of their Drupal and WordPress websites - including best practices on site configurations. These reports are found in the Site Dashboard under the Status tab and are accessible by site team members. Recent updates to the "Status" dashboard include improved WordPress Multisite compatibility, as well as a security update to better prevent XSS attacks.
