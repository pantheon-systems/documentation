The following user interface enhancements are now available for Content Publisher: 

* [Disconnecting a Google Workspace account is now self-serve](https://docs.content.pantheon.io/accounts#h.n1p26rh2cl4o), previously required contacting support 
* Refreshing [collection status](https://docs.content.pantheon.io/glossary#h.9ihsmmdq0l5t) can now be done manually in the Content Dashboard 
* [Publishing to Pantheon’s playground](https://docs.content.pantheon.io/quickstart) now supports personal Gmail accounts 

We have also released several minor bug fixes, user interface enhancements, and formatting issues - which don’t affect functionality, but do improve the end user experience.
