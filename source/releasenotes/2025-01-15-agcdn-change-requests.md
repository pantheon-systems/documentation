## What's new?

An improved support experience for [Advanced Global CDN (AGCDN)](/guides/agcdn) customers is now available in the **Edge** tab of your professional workspace. 

From this tab you can now submit a change request form for modifying AGCDN configurations. After the form is submitted, a new AGCDN support ticket is created with improved routing internally - resulting in fewer delays and faster updates.

To learn more about this experience, see [related documentation](/guides/agcdn/submit-request).

## Why is this being done?

Previously, the Advanced Global CDN service lacked a dedicated category within the Support dashboard. This could result in delays and inefficiencies when processing requests, as critical details were often missing or had to be clarified through additional communication. The new Change Request Form is designed to collect all necessary details upfront.

## What's next?

The roll-out of this form is a first step toward providing Pantheon's AGCDN customers with a dedicated area in the workspace to make AGCDN changes. In the future, we'd like for customers to be able to make AGCDN configuration changes on their own, if they choose to do so.
