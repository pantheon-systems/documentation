We're thrilled to announce the availability of WP-CLI v2.9.0 on the Pantheon platform.

WP-CLI is easily accessible for any WordPress site on Pantheon through our CLI, [Terminus](/terminus). Manage your WordPress installations efficiently with the power of WP-CLI at your fingertips.

<h3>Highlights</h3>

* **Enhanced PHP 8.2 support:**
This release is dedicated to refining support for [PHP 8.2](/guides/php), the recommended version on Pantheon.
* **Optimized compatibility with WordPress 6.4:**
We've worked to guarantee seamless compatibility, providing you with the best performance and features available.
* **Introducing "wp config is-true" command:**
Our Pantheon engineers have introduced the new "wp config is-true" command. Specifically designed for shell scripting, this command improves WP-CLI functionality and is already integrated into some of our automation processes.
* **Bug fixes:**
Although primarily a compact release, WP-CLI v2.9.0 brings a significant impact with crucial bug fixes to enhance usability.
