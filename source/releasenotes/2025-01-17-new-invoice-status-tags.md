Weâ€™ve added a feature to the billing section of the Pantheon dashboard that helps you quickly check the status of your most recent invoice.

## What's new?

* **Status tags:** Your latest invoice now displays a "Paid" or "Unpaid" tag for easy tracking.

This update makes it easier to stay informed about your latest payment without impacting dashboard performance.

## What's next?

This effort towards improved billing visibility in the dashboard lays the groundwork for further improvements down the road. In a future update, we plan to apply "Paid" and "Unpaid" tags across all invoices, rather than just the most recent invoice.
