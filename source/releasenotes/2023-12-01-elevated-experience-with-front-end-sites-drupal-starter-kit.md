The Pantheon Drupal Starter Kit for Front-End Sites has undergone significant improvements.
* **Setup experience**: The setup process is now more user-friendly and guided for a seamless experience.
* **Health check script**: The newly introduced health check script alerts you to known configuration issues before a build fails.
* **Front-End Sites settings**: Effortlessly navigate through the Settings page, simplifying the testing of your preview endpoint, and allowing convenient copying of environment variables for use in the Front-End Sites Dashboard.
