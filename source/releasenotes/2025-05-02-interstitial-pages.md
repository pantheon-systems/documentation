Beginning May 6, 2025, newly created sandbox sites (sites not on a paid plan) will an interstitial page when a visitor loads a page for the first time.

_todo: screenshots_

After clicking through this page, a cookie is set in the browser to prevent the interstitial page from showing again for the same visitor to the same environment for 24 hours.

This change is being made to clarify for visitors that the site is not live and to prevent confusion. It also discourages abuse of the sandbox sites for spam or other malicious purposes.

For more information about this change, including how to bypass the interstitial page for automated testing, see [Interstitial Pages on Sandbox Sites](/interstitial-pages-on-sandbox-sites/).
