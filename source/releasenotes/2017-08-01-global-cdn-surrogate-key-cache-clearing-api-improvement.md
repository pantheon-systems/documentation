We improved cache clearing behavior for a large number of surrogate keys or cache tags. The fix was made internally by Pantheon and no action is required if you are already running WordPress or Drupal versions of Pantheon Advanced Page Cache. See the  Pantheon Advanced Page Cache for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_advanced_page_cache) pages for more information.
