<h3>Highlights</h3>

* **Bug fixes:** Fixed an issue identified by a user ([offshorealert](https://wordpress.org/support/users/offshorealert/) on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/issue-building-query-when-you-are-parsing-the-tax_query)) that prevented `tax_query` arguments from being parsed correctly by Solr.

You can upgrade to Solr Search for WordPress 2.5.3 from your WordPress dashboard on your Pantheon development environment to get this update.
