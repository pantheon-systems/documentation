Visibility into composer logs has been a top customer request. Now, if you need to debug a composer build failure due to an error, install the Terminus Composer Logs plugin on your machine to view more details. Upstream Update logs are also available. Installation instructions and command usage can be found [here in the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-composer-logs-plugin).
