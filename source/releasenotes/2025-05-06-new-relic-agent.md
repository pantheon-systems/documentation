The New Relic PHP agent has been updated to the latest version, v11.8.0.22, for all eligible versions of PHP. Support for PHP 7.0 and 7.1 was removed in version 11.0, so the New Relic PHP agent for those versions remains at v10.22.0.12.

This update brings several enhancements and fixes compared to the previous version, including some fixes for Drupal errors and exception handling that may now surface some errors that previously were going unreported.

For a detailed list of all changes and improvements, see the [complete New Relic PHP agent changelog](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/).
