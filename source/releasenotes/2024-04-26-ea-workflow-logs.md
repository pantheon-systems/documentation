We're announcing Workflow Logs, a powerful new feature for enhanced visibility and troubleshooting operations on the Pantheon platform. The feature can be accessed directly from your site dashboard, adjacent to the Support tab.

## Key features
* **Status overview**: View key information on the status of workflows, including progress statuses, along with additional details such as start time, end time, initiating team member, and environment.
* **In-depth details**: Access code sync, error details, build logs, and Quicksilver posted messages from the expandable sections.
* **Filtering**: The workflows displayed comprise a curated list of user-relevant workflows. Further narrow your focus by utilizing filters to quickly find specific workflows by environment or completion status.
* **Archiving**: Export all visible workflows to a CSV file for archival purposes with the **'Download to CSV'** button.
