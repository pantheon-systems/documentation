Today, Pantheon's Content Publisher moves from Beta to Public Preview. In Beta, teams needed to request access to use Content Publisher. Now any team with a Google Workspace can sign up to use Content Publisher to publish to their website straight from Google Docs, [**with a free 30-day trial of our enterprise-level plan.**](https://pantheon.io/content-publisher-free-trial)

If you wish to use Content Publisher with your WordPress, Drupal, or Next.js sites, **[sign up here.](https://pantheon.io/content-publisher-free-trial)**

This promotion to Public Preview also reflects increased product maturity in areas like:

* [Pricing information](https://pantheon.io/content-publisher-free-trial#pricing) and [free trial](https://pantheon.io/content-publisher-free-trial) of enterprise-level features now publicly available.
* New releases for our [Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_content_publisher) and [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-content-publisher-wordpress) with bug fixes and feature improvements.
* Multiple Google Workspaces can now be connected to a single Content Publisher account.
* [Content approval workflows](https://docs.content.pantheon.io/approval-workflow#h.lwsqxtbqyglx) that allow content editors to submit content to be approved and published by administrators.
* Live chat support now directly integrated within the Content Dashboard interface.
