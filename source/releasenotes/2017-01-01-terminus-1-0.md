After months of retooling and feedback from users, we're excited to officially release Terminus 1.0! This release comes with a commitment to backwards compatibility for scripts and plugins, as well as a new core engine based on Symfony Console. Everything you've been doing with Terminus is included in this new version with more additions continually coming!
