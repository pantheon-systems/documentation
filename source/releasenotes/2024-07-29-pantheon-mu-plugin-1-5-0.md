The Pantheon MU Plugin [v1.5.0](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-mu-plugin/releases) update is now available. This latest update is included with next version of WordPress and can be installed on [WordPress (composer managed)](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/wordpress-composer) installs using composer update or by checking for updates in the dashboard.

### What's new?

This update introduces a new "comptibility layer" feature designed to enhance the compatibility of your siteâ€™s plugins. Here are the key highlights:

* **Automatic compatibility fixes:** The compatibility layer automatically detects many plugins listed in our [WordPress Plugins and Themes with Known Issues](https://docs.pantheon.io/plugins-known-issues) guide. If a plugin is detected, relevant fixes are applied automatically.

* **Compatibility reports:** If a plugin is detected but no fix is available, the compatibility layer generates a report for you.

* **Site health integration:** Compatibility reports are added to a new section of the Site Health page, accessible under the Tools menu in your WordPress administration dashboard.

Upgrade now to take advantage of these enhancements and ensure your plugins work seamlessly with your WordPress site.
