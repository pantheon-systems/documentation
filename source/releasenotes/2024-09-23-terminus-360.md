With the [Terminus 3.6.0 release](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/3.6.0), you can now rename site labels directly through Terminus using the new `site:label:set` command. Previously, updating a site's label required contacting Support.

A site on Pantheon has both a machine name and a human-readable label:
* **Machine name** (e.g., `my-awesome-site`): Used in [Terminus commands](/terminus/examples#siteenv), constructs [platform domains](/guides/domains), and cannot be changed after site creation.
* **Human-readable label** (e.g., `My Awesome Site`): Shown in the Pantheon workspace and site dashboards. This label can be changed after site creation via Terminus. For example:  

```shell{promptUser: user}
terminus site:label:set my-awesome-site "My Awesome Site D11"
```

**Upgrade today to take advantage of this new command.**

## How to upgrade Terminus
If you manage your installation via Homebrew on macOS, you can update Terminus with the following command:

```shell{promptUser: user}
brew upgrade pantheon-systems/external/terminus
```
For other systems, see additional upgrade instructions [here](/terminus/install).
