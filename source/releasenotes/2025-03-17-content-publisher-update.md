We have released a new version of the Content Publisher service (back-end + admin interface + Google Docs add-on + CLI + JS SDK v3.11.2).

## What's new?

* [**Authentication tokens**](https://pcc.pantheon.io/docs/release-notes#h.xm86x7zetwrt): You can now manage tokens from the Content Publisher administration interface settings. Previously, this was partially managed from the CLI.
* [**Ingest API**](https://pcc.pantheon.io/docs/release-notes#h.xm5hgdtj084u): This open API allows developers to programmatically ingest content in Content Publisher from other 3rd party services.
* [**Include in search**](https://pcc.pantheon.io/docs/release-notes#h.mnxclnrnx5sx): New toggle added so you can easily include or exclude content from search.
