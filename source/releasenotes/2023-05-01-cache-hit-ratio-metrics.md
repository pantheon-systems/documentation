Cache Hit Ratio data is now available on the site Dashboard under the Live Environment's Metrics tab. A site's Cache Hit Ratio measures how efficiently the Global CDN is being leveraged to give users the fastest response time vs using a site's resources to process requests. This information has also been added to Terminus `env:metrics` [command](/terminus/commands/env-metrics).
