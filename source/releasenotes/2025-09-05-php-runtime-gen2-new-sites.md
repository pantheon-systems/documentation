_**Editorial notes:**_
  * _The date for this has been moved from September 10, 2025 to September 17, 2025._

Starting September 17, 2025, new sites created on the platform will use PHP Runtime Generation 2.

[PHP Runtime Generation 2](/php-runtime-generation-2) includes updated extensions, the latest PHP version, and enhanced security features. This new PHP runtime is currently available in beta and will begin rolling out to existing sites on September 24.

Some PHP extensions and OS packages have not been ported over to Generation 2 yet, and may never be ported. Review the [OS Packages and PHP Extensions documentation](/php-runtime-generation-2#os-packages) to review these changes. If your new sites depend on these, we recommend you [downgrade to Generation 1](/php-runtime-generation-2#q-can-i-switch-back-to-the-previous-php-runtime-if-i-encounter-issues) and contact your Customer Success Manager or create a support ticket to discuss your site needs.
