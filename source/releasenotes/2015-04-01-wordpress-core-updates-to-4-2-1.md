WordPress 4.2 came out this month to great fanfare. For more details, see [Version 4.2 announcement](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2). A few days later, the core team released a security update. We were on it, and the most recent version is available in all Pantheon WordPress Site Dashboards. We recommend updating all of your WordPress sites as soon as possible.
