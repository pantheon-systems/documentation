In response to your feedback, Pantheon has temporarily paused the automated overage program. We're currently evaluating the program and the potential enhancements that will address your feedback and deliver the best possible experience to you.

To ensure there is no disruption in your siteâ€™s performance, we recommend you to:
- Continue monitoring your site plan's traffic;
- Ensure you're on the right site plan to maintain a secure, performant, and lightning-fast website.

The Pantheon Team will continue to:
- Work on tooling to help you better monitor your site traffic;
- Work with you at renewal to review historical traffic and determine the best fit plan.

We appreciate your continued partnership and patience as we enhance our policy to better serve you.
