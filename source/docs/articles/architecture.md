## Cloud Infrastructure Provider
Pantheon proudly runs on RackSpace and Amazon S3. We utilize the most advanced hardware our infrastructure providers can provide, and we do so very efficiently.

## Endpoint VM
Each of the bare-metal physical machines we run on is called an endpoint. We manage a single VM on each endpoint, running Fedora 20 and CoreOS.

## System D custom C-groups (Containers)


## Edge
Traffic coming to your site first hits the Edge routing and caching layer.

## STYX Boxes


## HA Proxy


## Varnish


## NGINX


## Application containers

##Code

If you connect to your Dev environment's codebase via SFTP, you'll notice your site's codebase is inside the /code directory. Git pushes end up in this directory.

## Pantheon File System
