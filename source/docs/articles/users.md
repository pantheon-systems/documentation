##User Roles

Pantheon offers different user types to enable role-based permissions. The most common are:

- **Team Member:** Has the ability to manage settings, add and remove team members, and deploy to the Test and Live environments.
- **Developer:** Has the ability to deploy code to CDEs and the Dev environment.
- **Site Owner:** This is the person who pays for the site. [Learn more about being a site owner](/docs/articles/sites/new-site-owner/).
