title: Drupal 8 on Pantheon
---

[Drupal 8 RC2](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0) is now available on Pantheon! New Drupal 8 sites will use the [drops-8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8) upstream repository and can be created via [Terminus](/docs/articles/local/cli) or the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/products/drupal8/spinup). To bring an existing Drupal 8 site onto Pantheon, see [Migrate to Pantheon: Manual Site Import](/docs/articles/sites/migrate/manual-site-import). However, things may break and our support is limited at this time. 

The following platform features are not yet available on Pantheon for sites running Drupal 8:

 - [Solr](/docs/articles/sites/apache-solr)
 - [Redis](/docs/articles/sites/redis-as-a-caching-backend#using-redis-with-drupal-8)
 - The [Status tool's](/docs/articles/drupal/launch-check-drupal-performance-and-configuration-analysis) [Site Audit](https://www.drupal.org/project/site_audit) functionality

For more details on Pantheon's platform support for Drupal 8, follow the [Pantheon D8 issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/issues?q=is%3Aopen).
