We highly recommend load testing a site both prior and post launch to ensure your site is optimally configured.

## Before You Begin

You should:

- [Enable New Relic](/docs/articles/sites/newrelic/new-relic-performance-analysis#enabling-new-relic) to monitor internal execution performance without needing any additional modules or tools.
- Have access to a command-line environment, preferably with administrative privileges.

**Please Note: Load testing should only be performed on the Live environment**. Dev has much lower default caching settings than other environments to facilitate iterative development. Test has the exact same configuration as Live, but Test can only have one appserver, while Live can have as many as your plan allows. If disruptive behavior occurs outside of the Live environment, the site may be temporarily disabled to prevent disruption to other customers.

## Performance vs. Scalability

There are two things to test for:

1. **Performance**: the response time for an individual request
2. **Scalability**: the ability to deliver with optimal response time to a larger number of concurrent requests

High-performance is the ability to deliver a page in under a second; scalability is the ability to deliver that page in under a second for many requests. It's important to understand the difference between these two dimensions and that there are trade-offs between performance and scalability.

## Verify Varnish is Working

To verify that the [Varnish](/docs/articles/architecture/edge/varnish) cache is working, the `curl` command can be run with the `-I` flag to gather and display header information. Header information can also be obtained via [Firebug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebug_(software)) or [Inspect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) in the browser. The results should be something like this:

    curl -I http://live-yoursite.gotpantheon.com
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.0.10
    Date: Fri, 17 Aug 2012 23:47:36 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    cache-control: public, max-age=300
    last-modified: Fri, 17 Aug 2012 23:44:40 +0000
    expires: Sun, 11 Mar 1984 12:00:00 GMT
    etag: "1345247080"
    X-Varnish: 1082592805 1082586928
    Age: 176
    Via: 1.1 varnish
    X-Pantheon-Edge-Server: 108.166.96.132
    Vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie

The "Age" field should be greater than 0. If the max age is not greater than 0, please review  [Drupal's Performance and Caching Settings](/docs/articles/drupal/drupal-s-performance-and-caching-settings#drupal-s-performance-settings) and [Varnish Caching for High Performance](/docs/articles/architecture/edge/varnish) documentation.

**Until Varnish has been correctly configured, don't worry about further testing.**

## Timing an Uncached Page Request

Passing the curl command with `time` before it, as well as sending a `NO_CACHE` cookie, which prevents Varnish from caching the response, will test the actual response of the Application Containers backend:

    time curl -I -H "Cookie: NO_CACHE=1;" http://live-yoursite.gotpantheon.com

The command returns the following results. Note the appended timestamp at the bottom. The "real" time is the one to pay attention to:

    time curl -I -H "Cookie: NO_CACHE=1;" http://live-yoursite.gotpantheon.com
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.0.10
    Date: Fri, 17 Aug 2012 23:57:39 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    cache-control: public, max-age=300
    last-modified: Fri, 17 Aug 2012 23:57:38 +0000
    expires: Sun, 11 Mar 1984 12:00:00 GMT
    etag: "1345247858"
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    X-Varnish: 1082615375
    Age: 0
    Via: 1.1 varnish
    X-Pantheon-Edge-Server: 108.166.96.132
    Vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie

    real 0m0.874s
    user 0m0.036s
    sys 0m0.004s

As an added bonus, you can test specific-pages of a site by passing a specific URL, as well as the experience of a logged-in user by passing a PHP-Session ID.

To get the PHP-Session ID, log in to your site and check the browsers cookie setting and value. The Session ID can be passed in the following way:

    time curl -I -H "Cookie: SESSe6c673379860780ffbc45bdd6d9c1ab4=dKanNfIMe_0CnOMF7v1Qb5SpDN7UDvyQE8um-1Rpkcg;;" http://live-yoursite.gotpantheon.com

If you're not satisfied with the response time, focus should be shifted to optimizing the performance of the site.

## Testing Scale and Throughput

In order to test scale and throughput, we use AB, a simple tool made available by the Apache Project.

**Note: Do not raise the concurrency or total number of request values drastically. Small, measured tests should yield the proper results.**

Run the following command:

    ab -n 100 -c 5 http://live-yoursite.gotpantheon.com/

Varnish should now be properly configured, and what you've tested should generate good response times and a high requests per second.

As with `curl`, you can run `ab` with the following parameters: `-C NO_CACHE=1` parameter to stop Varnish from caching the response. `ab` returns the following output:

    ab -n 100 -c 5 -C NO_CACHE=1 http://live-yoursite.gotpantheon.com/

      99% 1280
     100% 1280 (longest request)

The output provides insight into the requests per second, the most critical element in regards to the scalability of a site. Pay attention to the 90/95% response time as well, as this gives an idea of how the site is actually performing. Check that the number of failed requests is 0; if it's not, this should be investigated.

**Note:** Testing with a session cookie to emulate the experience of a logged-in user is extremely important, as the contrast between an anonymous user and a logged-in user may be drastically different.

## Performance Goals

Response times vary from site to site depending on the size of your modules stack, database queries, etc. Generally, anything under 1 second is considered excellent, but this is up to you.

Emulating a logged in user's experience with `ab` is a key metric, as it provides the number of pages per second your site can generate on Pantheon. This number may determine whether or not you need to add additional Application Containers.

## Testing Tools

There are a number of other tools to consider when you are planning your load testing strategy. This can vary by the need for detail, nature of your site, or requirements for quality analysis.

## Next Steps

- Enable Redis (if you haven't already) to alleviate database bottlenecks.
- Debug and Profile your website codebase. If you find a bottleneck you can't resolve, contact support.
