We love helping developers succeed! We also have limits to the support we can provide. The key to a great relationship is clear expectations of our support scope.

- We don't touch client code.
- We love adding features, but platform changes take time and consideration, and unfortunately feature requests are often declined if there is potential performance or user experience degradation.
- Pantheon provides a great backend, but cannot provide code-level debugging, Git training, or site architecture recommendations. New Relic and debugging can get you pretty far.
- If your site is slow or modules aren't working, please see our [performance articles](/docs/articles/sites/code/#performance). Issues with the platform are posted on our [status page](http://status.getpantheon.com). If there are no platform events, the solution is probably within the site's code.
- Pantheon can only assist if we can replicate the problem. Intermittent issues and server errors are rarely random, rather, they are issues with a yet undefined trigger. Please try to replicate and debug [site errors](/docs/articles/sites/errors-and-server-responses/), etc. in your Development environment.
- We recommend development on the platform, rather than on a local environment, whenever possible. Unexpected behavior, not apparent on local instances such as MAMP or shared hosting, can be due to different versions of PHP, different levels of error reporting, or server configuration. Pantheon is not responsible for resolving such issues.
- Pantheon support can quickly determine if an issue is platform related. We take full responsibility for our services and performance, but if something is affecting your site only, or a single environment only, we will most likely refer you to our debugging tutorials.
- If we see your site is a volcano of errors or overloading resources, we will contact you and ask you to take immediate action. If unresponsive, we may need to put the site into maintenance mode.
- Pantheon servers spin down after ~2 hours of idle time. LIVE environments on a paid plan will spin down after 12h of idle time. On receiving a web request, they are spun up, usually within 30 seconds. If you try to connect to the backend, you may experience an error. Load the home page, and you can connect.
