## Create Sites Faster And More Efficiently
The latest version of Pantheon's CLI, [Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli), incorporates not only Drush and WP-CLI, but also the vast majority of tasks available to you within the Pantheon Dashboard. You can create new sites, clone one environment to another, create branches, check for upstream updates, and more. By using Terminus, a site administrator can massively reduce the time spent on relatively simple tasks. In this guide, we will walk through the basics of creating a completely new Drupal site on Pantheon, installing some contrib modules, committing code, and cloning from one site environment to another&mdash;all through the Terminus CLI.

## Installing Terminus
Installing Terminus is a fairly straight forward process. Just follow [these instructions](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/wiki/Installation).

After you install Terminus, do a quick status check to make sure it works. Depending on your OS, the output may vary, but here's a sample:

```
$ terminus auth login
Your email address?: email@domain.com
Your dashboard password (input will not be shown):
Logging in as email@domain.com
Saving session data

        .+.
        .+?:
         .+??.
           ??? .
           +???.
      +?????????=.
      .???????????.
      .????????????.

     ########### ########

     #########.+?? ######.
               .+?.
         .????????????.
           +??????????,
            .????++++++.
              ????.
              .???,
               .~??.
                 .??
                  .?,.
```

Excellent! You've installed Terminus and logged into your Pantheon account. For a full list of commands, [refer to this page](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/wiki/Available-Commands).

## Using Terminus

### List Your Current Sites

Terminus can be used on any Pantheon hosted website you have, and it can also create new sites! Let's get a list of your current Pantheon sites:

```
$ terminus sites show
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
| Site                     | Framework | Service Level | UUID                     |
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
| terminus-create          | drupal8   | free          | terminus-create          |
| git-import-example       | drupal    | free          | git-import-example       |
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
```
### Create a Brand New Site

Now let's create a new site:

```
$ terminus sites create
Human readable label for the site: Terminus CLI Create
Machine name of the site; used as part of the default URL [ if left blank will be terminusclicreate]: terminus-cli-create

  1. None

$ terminus sites show
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
| Site                     | Framework | Service Level | UUID                     |
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
| terminus-cli-create      | drupal    | free          | terminus-cli-create      |
| terminus-create          | drupal8   | free          | terminus-create          |
| git-import-example       | drupal    | free          | git-import-example       |
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+

```

###Update the Code

Now that the site is created, the next step is to run a Drush install command to get a fully functional Drupal set ready to go for development. Terminus will run most available Drush commands by simply adding the word "drush" to the command directly afterward, along with the site's Pantheon machine name.

```
$ terminus drush site-install --site=terminus-cli-create
Running drush site-install  on terminus-cli-create-dev
dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5@appserver.dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5c0d11a2464.drush.in's password:
Could not find a Drupal settings.php file at ./sites/default/settings.php.
You are about to create a sites/dev-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io/files directory and create a sites/dev-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io/settings.php file and DROP all tables in your 'pantheon' database. Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
Starting Drupal installation. This takes a few seconds ...                  [ok]
Installation complete.  User name: admin  User password: ********         [ok]
```

Open a web browser and check out your brand new Drupal site! See the status of each of the site's environments by using the "terminus site environments" command.

```
$ terminus site environments --site=terminus-cli-create
+------+------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+---------+
| Name | Created    | Domain                               | OnServer Dev? | Locked? |
+------+------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+---------+
| test | 1423175994 | test-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io | false         | false   |
| dev  | 1423175993 | dev-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io  | true          | false   |
| live | 1423175995 | live-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io | false         | false   |
+------+------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+---------+
```

(insert screenshot of new Drupal site here)

###Install Contrib Modules
While the site is still in SFTP mode, (Dev environment row, OnServer Dev? true), we can use Drush to download and install some Drupal contrib modules, such as Views and Administration Menu.

```
$ terminus drush dl admin_menu --site=terminus-cli-create
Running drush dl admin_menu  on terminus-cli-create-dev
dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5@appserver.dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5c0d11a2464.drush.in's password:
Project admin_menu (7.x-3.0-rc5) downloaded to                         [success]
/srv/bindings/c183403f14224eac8471ec0000f9e653/code/sites/all/modules/admin_menu.
Project admin_menu contains 3 modules: admin_devel, admin_menu_toolbar, admin_menu.
tests-MacBook-Pro:~ erikmathy$ terminus drush en admin_menu,admin_menu_toolbar --site=terminus-cli-create
Running drush en admin_menu,admin_menu_toolbar  on terminus-cli-create-dev
dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5@appserver.dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5c0d11a2464.drush.in's password:
The following extensions will be enabled: admin_menu, admin_menu_toolbar
Do you really want to continue? (y/n): y
admin_menu was enabled successfully.                                        [ok]
admin_menu_toolbar was enabled successfully.                                [ok]
```

Not bad, eh? All this without a single GUI or web browser click! If you look at the site's Dashboard, the new code will be displayed there, waiting to be committed.

![The dashboard showing the code was deployed to the Dev environment](/docs/assets/images/terminus-cli-code-to-commit-dashboard.png)

Let's commit it all into the Git repo with the "terminus site code commit" command:

```
$ terminus site code commit --site=terminus-cli-create --env=dev
Commit 1 changes? [y/n] y
Success: Successfully committed.
+---------------------+--------+--------+------------------------------------------+------------------+
| Time                | Author | Labels | Hash                                     | Message          |
+---------------------+--------+--------+------------------------------------------+------------------+
| 2015-02-05T22:40:14 | Root   | dev    | 4297d007d1697e1b9a90073510183149dd1c827f | "Initial Commit" |
+---------------------+--------+--------+------------------------------------------+------------------+
```

Open the Pantheon Dashboard, and you'll see the new files are shown in the Git commit log.

![The dashboard's showing the code was deployed to the Dev environment](/docs/assets/images/terminus-cli-code-committed-dashboard.png)

And finally, let's create the Test environment to move the code, files, and DB from Dev onward in the Pantheon workflow using "create-env".

```
$ terminus site create-env --site=terminus-cli-create --env=test

  1. dev
  2. test
  3. live

Select Clone from?: 1

Cloning database ...

Success: Successfully created Environment!
```

## Congratulations!
You just created a brand new Drupal site on Pantheon! You added modules, committed code, and moved it all from Dev to Test without using a single checkbox, radio button, or colored Ajax slider. To top it off, by using Terminus, it all happened in a third of the time. There is a whole new world of possibility open to you. Now go forth and CLI!

##  Next Steps
- Do you use WordPress? Try [Using WP-CLI on Pantheon](/docs/articles/wordpress/create-a-wordpress-site-from-the-commandline-with-terminus-and-wp-cli).

- After you've mastered Terminus, take it a step further with [Continuos Integration](docs/articles/local/continuous-integration-solutions).
