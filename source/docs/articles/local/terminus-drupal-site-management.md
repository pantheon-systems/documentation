The latest version of Pantheon's CLI, [Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli), incorporates not only Drush and WP-CLI, but also the vast majority of tasks available to you within the Pantheon Dashboard. You can create new sites, clone one environment to another, create branches, check for upstream updates, and more! By using Terminus in this manner, a site administrator can massively reduce the time they spend on relatively simple tasks. In this guide, we will walk through the basics of creating a completely new Drupal site on Pantheon, installing some contrib modules, commiting code and cloning from one site environment to another, all through the Terminus CLI.

#### Installing Terminus

Installing Terminus is a fairly straight forward process. Just follow the [instructions found here](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/wiki/Installation).

Now that you've got Terminus installed you can get a quick status check to be sure it works. Depending on your OS, this output may vary, but here's a sample for reference:

```
$ terminus auth login
Your email address?: email@domain.com
Your dashboard password (input will not be shown):

        .+.

           ??? .
           +???.
      +?????????=.
      .???????????.
      .????????????.

               .+?.

           +??????????,

              ????.
              .???,
               .~??.
                 .??
                  .?,.
```

Excellent! You've installed Terminus and logged into your Pantheon with it. For a full list of commands, [please refer to this page](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/wiki/Available-Commands).

#### List Your Current Sites, Create A New One

Terminus can work on any Pantheon hosted website you might have, but it can also create new ones! Let's get a list of your current Pantheon based websites.

```
$ terminus sites show
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
| Site                     | Framework | Service Level | UUID                     |
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
| terminus-create          | drupal8   | free          | terminus-create          |
| git-import-example       | drupal    | free          | git-import-example       |
+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+
```
Now we can create a brand new site!

```
$ terminus sites create
Human readable label for the site: Terminus CLI Create
Machine name of the site; used as part of the default URL [ if left blank will be terminusclicreate]: terminus-cli-create

$ terminus sites show

+--------------------------+-----------+---------------+--------------------------+

```

With the site created, the next step is to run a Drush install command to get a fully functional Drupal set ready to go for development. Terminus will run most available Drush commands by simply adding the word "drush", the command in question directly afterwards and the site's Pantheon machine name.

```
$ terminus drush site-install --site=terminus-cli-create
Running drush site-install  on terminus-cli-create-dev
dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5@appserver.dev.a248f559-fab9-49cd-983c-f5c0d11a2464.drush.in's password:

You are about to create a sites/dev-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io/files directory and create a sites/dev-terminus-cli-create.pantheon.io/settings.php file and DROP all tables in your 'pantheon' database. Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
