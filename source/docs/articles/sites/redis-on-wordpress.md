## How can I enable Redis on my site?

Currently, all plans except for Personal can use Redis. Redis is available to Sandbox plans for developmental purposes, but Redis will not be available going live on a Personal plan.

Plans Redis is available:



 | Plans        | Supported
 | ------------- |:-------------:|
 | Sandbox      | **Yes** |
 | Personal      | No      |
 | Professional | **Yes**      |
 | Business | **Yes**      |
 | Enterprise | **Yes**      |
 | Pantheon One | **Yes**      |

Enabling Redis Cache Server from Pantheon Site Dashboard (Settings >> Add Ons >> Add)

##Setting up Redis with WordPress

Pantheon maintains the [wp-redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/) plugin. On our platform please follow the following steps:

1.  Download and install the WP-Redis plugin by either uploading it or downloading it through the WordPress dashboard
  * After you install the plugin, `do not activate the plugin`
2. Go to the WP-Redis plugin directory (wp-content/plugins/wp-redis/) and **move** the file `object-cache.php` to the directory (wp-content/)
  * Make sure the `object-cache.php` file is deleted from the WP-Redis directory
3. Login to the WordPress dashboard and go to the *Plugins* section and click on **Drop-Ins**

This is one way to confirm that it's setup correctly. The other way is to check with **redis-cli**.

### Using the Redis command-line client

You don't need to install anything to use Redis on Pantheon. However, if you want to manually connect to the Pantheon hosted Redis server for debugging, you'll need to install Redis locally. If you don't already have Redis installed,Â it can be downloaded from [http://redis.io/download](http://redis.io/download).

To verify that Redis is working, use the Redis Connection Info from the dashboard. Once you've logged in, execute the following command:

    redis> keys *

The command should return the existing Redis keys. Example:

    redis> keys *
     1) "pantheon-rediscache_menu:links:management:tree-data:en:27cbcc1096e9daf2c319c2c"
     2) "pantheon-rediscache:features_module_info"
     3) "pantheon-rediscache_bootstrap:bootstrap_modules"
     4) "pantheon-rediscache_menu:menu_item:b38e608d4f709b7c1fcb6ac5f6dd2ab72a9a034"

If Redis is configured properly, it should output appropriate keys. If it returns nothing (empty), proceed to the troubleshooting section below.

To check if a specific key exists, you can pass the "exists" command. For example:

    redis> SET key1 "Hello"
    OK
    redis> EXISTS key1
    (integer) 1
    redis> EXISTS key2
    (integer) 0
    redis>

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot activate the WP-Redis plugin?
You **do not need to activate** the plugin at all. Once you install it, move the `object-cache.php` file over the the **/wp-content/** directory and delete `object-cache.php` from the WP-Redis directory on the server.

### Getting fatal error being shown in the WordPress dashboard

![Redis fatal error](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/juchniewicz/ScreenShot2015-01-12at34506PM.png)

If you are seeing the error message `Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class WP_Object_Cache...` then you have not deleted the `object-cache.php` from the WP-Redis plugin directory.
