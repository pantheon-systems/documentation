Change Management is a feature of Organizations that enables role-based permissions for users in the Organization and team members of Sites owned by the Organization in order to restrict who can develop, deploy, and manage other users in the Organization or Site.

Partners receive Change Management for free. Enterprise customers can enable it by purchasing the add-on.

##Features
* Organizations with Change Management can set default roles/permissions for their users in the People tab.
* A Site owned by an Organization with Change Management will have permissions in the Team window to add one-off team members, such as subcontractors.
* A Site owned by an Organization with Change Management can add another Organization with a reduced role.
* Agencies added to Sites by subscription owners are able to use Change Management internally, but the subscription owners are not&mdash;they can only add full team members.
* All users in an Organization can see other users and their roles.

####Scenarios
An Enterprise Organization hires an Agency to develop its site, but wants to restrict the ability of the Agency to deploy the site to production. The enterprise can reserve deployment privileges for its internal IT team, preventing unintended deployments not initiated by the Enterprise.  

An Enterprise customer that has a site and simply wants to have role-based permissions to control who can deploy to production on its own development team.


##Roles and Permissions
Each user in the Organization is assigned a role when they are invited to join, and the role is assigned by the user who invites them. Roles have predefined permissions that vary depending on which Dashboard you are in (Site or Organization).


###Add a New User
1. Click the **People** tab.
2. Click **Add User**.
3. Enter the email address of the new user, select a role, and click **Add user**.

An email confirmation is sent to the user. After they click the confirmation link in the email to create their account, they will be added to the Org or Site.


###Edit an Existing User
1. Click the **People** tab.
2. Select the user's name, click **Operations**, and choose **Change Role**.
3. Select the role from the drop-down, and click **Set User Role**.

##Change Management - Enabled

By default, Change Management is enabled for Partners, Allies, and Enterprise customers.

##Change Management - Disabled
By default, Change Management is not enabled for resellers and OEM Partners. If Change Management is disabled, roles cannot be selected at the Organization or Site levels. At the Organization level, a checkbox appears to set a user as an Administrator, otherwise it defaults to the Unprivileged role. At the Site level, there is no role selector&mdash;all users are Team Members.
