The Pantheon platform provides each site environment with a dedicated MySQL container running [MariaDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) that can be maintained remotely or locally depending on your workflow. For a comprehensive list of MySQL settings, [access your database](/docs/articles/local/accessing-mysql-databases/#database-connection-information) and use the [SHOW VARIABLES](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/show-variables.html) statement.

Using the Workflow tool, you can overwrite the databases on your site's Dev or Test environment with the database on your Live environment, allowing you to pull content from Live in to other environments.

<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Warning:</strong>  Pushing content up to Live should almost never be done to a launched site, as it can overwrite the environment configurations. See <a href="https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/code/using-the-pantheon-workflow/">Using the Pantheon Workflow</a>. </div>

### MySQL Clients
You can use any number of MySQL clients such as [PHPMyAdmin](/docs/articles/local/using-phpmyadmin-to-locally-administer-a-database/) or [MySQL Workbench](/docs/articles/local/using-mysql-workbench-to-access-a-database/) to  administer your site's database
and [export configurations](/docs/articles/sites/code/using-the-pantheon-workflow/#exporting-configuration) as needed.
