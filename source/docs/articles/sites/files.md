Files are user uploads, usually images or documents. They are excluded from version control via Pantheon's .gitignore files:

- [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/blob/master/.gitignore)
- [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/blob/master/.gitignore)

The Pantheon architecture is comprised of highly available [application containers](/docs/articles/sites/all-about-application-containers/) that are seamlessly integrated with Valhalla, our cloud-based filesystem. This means that your files are not local to the application containers running your site's codebase.

Valhalla symbolically links the `wp-content/uploads` directory for WordPress and the `sites/default/files` directory for Drupal within the `/files` directory. Any [non-standard file locations](/docs/articles/sites/files/non-standard-files-locations/) should be symbolically linked to `/files` or moved manually.

## Access via SFTP
You can connect directly to the filesystem by copying your [connection information](/docs/articles/sites/code/developing-directly-with-sftp-mode/#sftp-connection-information) into popular SFTP clients such as [Filezilla](/docs/articles/local/filezilla/) and navigating to the `/files` directory.
