At some point, you may need or want to delete one of your sites on Pantheon. Deleting a site requires just a few simple steps.

### Delete Your Site

Click the “_Settings_” link in the upper-right corner of your site's workspace.

Go to the "Delete" when the modal loads up. Hit the "Delete Site" button to launch the confirmation dialog.

You will notice that the confirmation dialog requires you to enter the site title; this insures you're aware of the site you're deleting. There is no recovery. There is no undo. Make sure you've downloaded a backup if you need any code, content, or files from the site.

After deleting a site, you will be returned to your Sites & Account dashboard. Note you'll have an extra Dev site slot since you've deleted a site.
