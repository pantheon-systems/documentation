Pantheon has powerful workflow tools that are packed with real-time features that are great for people working in teams and getting started is easy and simple.

## Select the Team Tool

Click the “_Team_” link in the upper-right corner of your site's workspace.

## Add a Team Member

If there is another person (e.g. client, manager, accountant or developer) who has the payment information, you can add them as a team member and they can add their own card data and associate it with your site. The person paying for a site is considered the "owner" and cannot be removed from the site team.

Next, click on the "Add team member" button in the team management modal where you can enter the email address of an existing Pantheon user.



Once the user has been added to the project they will receive a welcome email notifying them that they are now a member of the site's team. This will allow them to access the site's codebase as well create backups, mark the site as private, clear your sites' caches, sync content and perform updates.

## Invite a Team Member

Sometimes you need to invite user's to a team or project who do not have Pantheon accounts. You can still add them to the project and they will be sent with an invite to become a team member on the site.

Once they have successfully signed up for an account, they will be automatically added to the team. As an added bonus if the user signs up, you get an extra free Dev site to spin up!

## Remove a Team Member

In the event that you  need to remove a team member from your site you can do this from the "Configuration" tab too. For all members who are not the site owner, you will notice a button that will give you the option to remove them from the project.

By clicking on the Remove" button a modal (pop-up) will open where you will have a chance to review your selection to make sure you are removing the correct person from the team.

If you delete a user from a site they will lose the ability to perform any operations on that site. Enter the email address of an existing Pantheon user.

## Change the Site Owner

The owner of a site can be changed in a few simple steps:

1. ​Click "Team" in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Click "Make Owner" next to the team member that should receive ownership of the site.

The new site owner now has the ability to add a credit card or change the site plan.

## Adding a Supporting Organization

One of the best things about Pantheon is that it's a great way to collaborate with agencies and shops on web projects. If you have contracted with a Pantheon partner or ally agency, you can add them to the site as a "supporting organization", which will give their company the access they need to help build, launch, or maintain your site.

1. Click "Team" in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Click "Add supporting organization" at the bottom of the team management modal.
3. Type the complete name of the organization. An exact match is required.
4. Confirm that the organization is the one you expected.

Please note: since supporting organizations have full access to a site, only the site owner can perform this action.
