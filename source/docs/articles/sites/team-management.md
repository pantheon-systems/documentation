Pantheon has powerful workflow tools that are packed with real-time features that are great for people working in teams, and getting started is easy and simple.

## Select the Team Tool

Click the **Team** link in the upper-right corner of your site's workspace.

## Add a Team Member

If there is another person (e.g. client, manager, accountant, or developer) who has the payment information, you can add them as a team member and they can add their own card data and associate it with your site. The person paying for a site is considered the "owner" and cannot be removed from the site team.

Click the **Add team member** button in the team management modal and enter the email address of an existing Pantheon user.


Once the user has been added to the project, they will receive a welcome email notifying them that they are now a member of the site's team. This will allow them to access the site's codebase, create backups, mark the site as private, clear your sites' caches, sync content, and perform updates.

## Invite a Team Member

Sometimes you need to invite users to a team or project who do not have Pantheon accounts. You can still add them to the project and they will be sent with an invite to become a team member on the site.

Once they have successfully signed up for an account, they will be automatically added to the team. As an added bonus if the user signs up, you get an extra free Dev site to spin up!

## Remove a Team Member

In the event that you need to remove a team member from your site, you can do this from the "Configuration" tab. All users can be removed except the "site owner".

After clicking the Remove button, a window will open and you can review your selection.



If you delete a user from a site, they will lose the ability to perform any operations on that site. Enter the email address of an existing Pantheon user.

## Change the Site Owner

The owner of a site can be changed in a few simple steps:

1. Click **Team** in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Click **Make Owner** next to the team member that should receive ownership of the site.

The new site owner now has the ability to add a credit card or change the site plan.

## Add a Supporting Organization

One of the best things about Pantheon is the ability to collaborate with agencies and shops on web projects. If you have contracted with a Pantheon partner or ally agency, you can add them to the site as a _supporting organization_, which will give their company access to help build, launch, or maintain your site.

1. Click **Team** in the upper-right of the site dashboard.
2. Click **Add Supporting Organization** at the bottom of the team management modal.
3. Enter the complete name of the agency. An exact match is required.
4. Check that the agency is the one you expected.
5. Click the Add button to make them a supporting organization.

**Note:** Because supporting organizations have full access to a site, only the site owner can perform this action.
