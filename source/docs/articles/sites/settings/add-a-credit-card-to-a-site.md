4. Select a plan.
After you've selected a plan, you'll get access to additional features like adding a custom domain name to your site, or for Pro accounts and higher, adding SSL and more.

## Accessing Premium Features

Developing your site and enjoying the advanced features like Workflow, Team Management, and New Relic can all be accessed for free; however, there are also premium features that require you to have a payment method associated with your site.

For example, when adding SSL you will be prompted to update your site's plan:  


 ![To enable SSL - choose at least a Pro plan](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/309237)


Clicking the message will take you to the Settings page to either select a plan or proceed to Billing to enter your billing information.
