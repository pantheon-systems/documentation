Every site on Pantheon is given three environments (Dev, Test, and Live), each with their own unique Platform domains which are bound to isolated resources. Platform domains are configured as subdomains, and are generated by prefixing the environment to the site name:

- dev-site-name.pantheonsite.io
- test-site-name.pantheonsite.io
- live-site-name.pantheonsite.io
- multidev-env-site-name.pantheonsite.io

## Legacy Base Domains
DNS configurations that use the `gotpantheon.com` Legacy Platform domain will continue to work, as requests are permanently redirected to `pantheonsite.io`. However, we recommend switching the CNAME value from `gotpantheon.com` to `pantheonsite.io` within the domain's DNS provider to take advantage of uptime and reliability improvements.

Sites using the `pantheon.io` Legacy Platform domain already enjoy these improvements and can use `pantheonsite.io` if they wish to standardize on the new domain.

## Vanity Domains
Pantheon Partners, Strategic Partners, Enterprise accounts, Resellers, and OEM Partners have the ability to replace `pantheonsite.io` for each environment on every site they run with a custom vanity domain.

For details, see [Vanity Domains](/docs/articles/organizations/vanity-domains/).
