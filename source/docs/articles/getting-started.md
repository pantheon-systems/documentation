Welcome to Pantheon! In a few simple steps, your Drupal or WordPress site will be up and running faster than ever.

## Create Your Free Account
If you haven't already done so, create your [free Pantheon account](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/register).
## Create a Site
Pantheon offers two free sandbox sites for all user accounts, which are useful for trying out the Pantheon platform. When one of your sites converts to a [paid plan](https://pantheon.io/pricing), you can start another sandbox site. If you need additional development sites, contact us and we'll be happy to work with you.

Visit your Dashboard to [create a site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create).

### Start From Scratch

1. **Choose a distribution**.  
If you want to develop directly on Pantheon, start with one of the many distributions available on the platform. For details, see [choosing your start state](/docs/articles/sites/create/choosing-start-state).

2. **Visit the Dev installation**.  
On the Site Dashboard, click **Visit Development Site** to open the Development environment.  You'll then be prompted to complete the Drupal or WordPress installation forms.  

### Import an Existing Site
If you have an existing Drupal or WordPress site that you want to import, choose **Import manually**. For additional details, see [Importing an Existing Drupal Site](/docs/articles/drupal/importing-an-existing-drupal-site-to-pantheon) or [Importing a WordPress Site](/docs/articles/wordpress/importing-a-wordpress-site/).

## Interact With Your Code
There are two ways to add and update your site's code: Git source code management and SFTP.

### Git Connection Mode
Git is a well-known, industry standard revision control system for managing site code. For more information, see [Starting with Git](/docs/articles/local/starting-with-git).

**Add an SSH Key**  
From your User Dashboard, select **Account**, and click **SSH Keys**.
For detailed instructions, see [Generating SSH Keys](/docs/articles/users/generating-ssh-keys/).

### SFTP Connection Mode
You can develop directly on the server using [SFTP mode](/docs/articles/sites/code/developing-directly-with-sftp-mode/).

## Pantheon Credentials
Your Pantheon.io username and password is only used to access your Dashboard to manage sites and submit support tickets. Any users on your Pantheon hosted sites will be distinct; there is no single sign-on between Pantheon.io and your Drupal or WordPress site, and Pantheon does not manage your users.  

There are a number of credentials available for developers, which can be found in the Dashboard. For details, see the following articles:

- [rsync and SFTP](/docs/articles/local/rsync-and-sftp)
- [Starting with Git](/docs/articles/local/starting-with-git/)
- [Accessing MySQL Databases](/docs/articles/local/accessing-mysql-databases/)
- [Redis as a Caching Backend](/docs/articles/sites/redis-as-a-caching-backend)

## The Pantheon Workflow
Familiarize yourself with the [Pantheon workflow](/docs/articles/sites/code/using-the-pantheon-workflow/), both for code deployment and content (database and files).

## Known Limitations
Familiarize yourself with Pantheon's [known limitations](/docs/articles/sites/known-limitations) now and save yourself the headache later on!

## Prepare for Launch by Adding a Credit Card
When you're ready to launch your site, you'll need to [add a credit card](/docs/articles/sites/settings/add-a-credit-card-to-a-site) to the site.

## The Pantheon Platform
To gain a better understanding of how the Pantheon system architecture works, see [All About Application Containers](/docs/articles/sites/all-about-application-containers/).
