While Pantheon provides several options for on-server development, [local development](/docs/articles/local/developing-locally) has a number of advantages, especially if continuous Internet access is a concern. Pantheon cannot troubleshoot or support local development solutions; however, we can provide some suggestions and known working solutions. If you're looking for a self-contained local development solution, check out [Kalabox](http://www.kalamuna.com/products/kalabox), which integrates with the Pantheon platform.
