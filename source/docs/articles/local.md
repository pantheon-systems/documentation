While Pantheon provides several options for on-server development, [local development](/docs/articles/local) has a number of advantages, especially if continuous Internet access is a concern. Pantheon cannot troubleshoot or support local development solutions; however, we can provide some suggestions and known working solutions. If you're looking for a self-contained local development solution, check out [Kalabox](http://www.kalamuna.com/products/kalabox), which integrates with the Pantheon platform.

For large teams/sites, we recommend using [Multidev](https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/multidev/) instead of local development.

## Before You Begin
Be sure you have:

- A local development stack. Pantheon uses a [particular architecture to maximize performance and availability](/docs/articles/sites/all-about-application-containers/), but it's possible to run the same code on a different configurations. As long as the solution supports a minimum of PHP 5.3 and MySQL, you should be fine.  [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/),  [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/),  [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), and [Kalabox](http://www.kalamuna.com/products/kalabox) all work.
- Git client for tracking code changes
- SFTP client, such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/ "FileZilla, a Cross-platform GUI SFTP client."), for transferring files OR rsync
- [Terminus](/docs/articles/local/cli/)
- [Drush](/docs/articles/local/drupal-drush-command-line-utility/) (optional)

To save time, clear the target site environment's cache. This can be done from the Pantheon Dashboard, from the application itself, or by running the following Terminus command:

```bash
terminus site clear-cache --site=<site> --env=<env>
```

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4>Note</h4>
Replace <code>&lt;site&gt;</code> with your site name, and <code>&lt;env&gt;</code> with the environment (Dev, Test, or Live). You can see a list of all your sites by running <code>terminus sites list</code></div>

There are three parts to any dynamic website:

1. Code (The application, modules or plugins, and themes)
1. Database (content)
1. Files (user uploaded or application generated)

You will need to transfer each one from Pantheon to your local environment.

## Get the Code

The first step is to get a `git clone` of your code from Pantheon to your local computer.

### Step 1: Go to Your Site Dashboard

Log in to Pantheon and load the Dashboard for the site you want to work on.

### Step 2: Copy the Git Clone Command

At the top of the development panel, look for the `git clone` command and copy and paste it in your terminal. It will look something like this:<br />
![Copy Past Git Clone](/docs/assets/images/git_string.png)<br />

### Step 3: Run Git Clone

On your local environment, go to where you want the code to reside. Git will create a directory as part of the clone, so you don't need to create one. Run the command you copied in step 2:

```nohighlight
git clone ssh://codeserver.dev.xxx@codeserver.dev.xxx.drush.in:2222/~/repository.git my-site
```
If everything worked correctly, you will see Git fetching the data:<br />
![Git Clone During](/docs/assets/images/git_clone.png)<br />
If you run into permission problems, check your [SSH key](/docs/articles/users/loading-ssh-keys/) setup. If the clone starts but can't complete, check your network to see if you have a current version of Git.

## Get the Database

### Via Dashboard
From within the Site Dashboard:

1. Create an on-demand backup by selecting **Workflow** > **Export** > **Export Database**.
2. Download the scheduled or on-demand backup by selecting **Backups** > **Backup Log** > **Database download link**.
3. Import the database into your local environment using a MySQL client:

````sql
$ gunzip < database.sql.gz | mysql -uUSER -pPASSWORD DATABASENAME
````
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4>Note</h4>
Replace <code>database.sql.gz</code> with the name of the database archive downloaded from Pantheon.</div>

### Via Terminus
Create and export the database by running the following Terminus commands:

```nohighlight
terminus site backup create --element=db --site=<site> --env=<env>
terminus site backup get --element=db --site=<site> --env=<env> --to-directory=$HOME/Desktop/ --latest
```

Import the archive into your local MySQL database using the following command:

````sql
$ gunzip < database.sql.gz | mysql -uUSER -pPASSWORD DATABASENAME
````
## Get the Files

For an overview of ways to transfer files, see [SFTP and rsync on Pantheon](/docs/articles/local/rsync-and-sftp/).

### Via Terminus

Run the following Terminus commands:
```nohighlight
terminus site backup create --element=files --site=<site> --env=<env>
terminus site backup get --element=files --site=<site> --env=<env> --to-directory=$HOME/Desktop/ --latest
```
This will create and download a backup of the site's files to your desktop.

### Via SFTP CLI

SFTP is slower, but easier for some to use:

- Get your SFTP login credentials by clicking **Connection Info**. You will see your connection credentials and a link to connect directly with your preferred client.
- From the terminal, navigate to the proper directory on your local file system:
    - **Drupal**: `sites/default`
    - **WordPress**: `wp-content/uploads`
- Paste the CLI command copied from your Dashboard.
- Run `get -r *` to transfer the files down to your local environment.

## Submit Changes to Pantheon

### Send the Code

Test your changes, then [commit locally and push to Pantheon](/docs/articles/local/starting-with-git/#push-changes-to-pantheon):

```bash
git commit -am "enter a summary of the changes"
```
Next, push the changes:

```bash
git push origin master
```

### Send the Database

Create an archive using the MySQL utility mysqldump:
```sql
mysqldump -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASENAME | gzip > database.sql.gz
```
Upload and import the file by going to your Pantheon Dashboard and selecting **Workflow** > **Import**.

### Send the Files

**Drupal: Via Drush**

Drush and rsync is by far the easiest way to send files for Drupal sites:

````nohighlight
drush -r . rsync --temp-dir=../tmp/ @self:sites/default/files/ @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV:%files
````

**WordPress or Drupal: Via SFTP**

Send files using SFTP:

- [Copy the SFTP CLI command](/docs/articles/sites/code/developing-directly-with-sftp-mode#sftp-connection-information)
- From terminal, navigate to the proper directory on your local file system:
    - **Drupal**: `sites/default/files`
    - **WordPress**: `wp-content/uploads`
- Paste the CLI command copied from your Dashboard
- Navigate to the correct remote directory by running `cd files`
- Run `put -r ./*` to transfer the files up

You can also transfer a single file or a single directory at a time instead of transferring every file, every time.
