##Relationships between Users, Sites, and Organizations


###Getting Familiar with Pantheon
One of Pantheon’s greatest advantages is in how it let’s you to collaborate with other users--you can choose to work alone, with other Pantheon users, with agency organizations, or with other members of your enterprise organization.

With all this flexibility, understanding the relationships between users, sites, and organizations will keep you on the path to success.

###You + My Dashboard
When you create an account with Pantheon, you create a user account. User accounts are capable of building, launching, and running a professional site. 

When you log into Pantheon, you’ll start off in My Dashboard where you’ll see a list of all your sites. You’ll also be able to manage your account settings and perform other tasks like creating new sites. 

Tip:  Whenever you need to get somewhere in the dashboard quickly, click on the Sites Dropdown and it will let you get to your Sites & Account dashboard, your sites, and the organizations you’re collaborating with. You can find the Sites Dropdown in the upper right of the dashboard by clicking on your user name. 

###You + Site Dashboard
The Site dashboard is where you’ll spend most of your time as a developer. This dashboard contains all your development environments for a single site:  Dev, Test, and Live. It’s also where you can clone, import, export, wipe, backup, manage billing and do a whole lot more with your site like working with Multidev--the cloud development environment for teams. 

The Site dashboard also has a handy feature for working with other users--the teams feature. With teams, you can invite other users to collaborate on your site. For example, a member of your team could be working on developing a new feature, while you focus on testing changes in the Test environment before deploying to Live. 

###You + Someone Else’s Site
At some point, another Pantheon user will want to work with you on their site and you’ll be invited to collaborate on it.  

When you accept an invitation to collaborate on someone else’s site, you’ll be added to that site’s team list and the site will get added to My Dashboard. 

What makes teams great is that once you’re on the team, everything else works the same--you can use all the same development and collaboration tools that you would see on your own sites. 

###About Organizations
Organizations are Pantheon’s way of letting groups of users work together when they already have a working relationship. Think of people working together at an agency developing sites for clients or an enterprise with its own internal web team running its corporate site. In both cases, these groups usually have some sort of pre-existing team structure that identifies who’s responsible for different functions like development or management of the overall team as well as having a need for tools to help organize their projects. These examples highlight why Pantheon developed special features for organizations through the Pantheon for Agencies (P4A) and Pantheon for Enterprise (P4E) products. 

The team feature mentioned in the Site dashboard also let’s you work with agency organizations by letting you add them to the site as a supporting organization to help develop your site. The supporting organization’s team structure is preserved and able to work on your site in a single, simple action. 

##You + Organizations
User’s create an organization in one of two ways:  if your group develops websites for others as a primary business activity, a user can create a new Pantheon for Agencies agency organization by creating one through the Pantheon site; if your group is developing its own corporate site, a representative of the company can set up a contract with Pantheon to create a Pantheon for Enterprise enterprise organization. 

Once the organization is created, you can invite other users in the agency or enterprise to join it, just like teams. However, unlike teams, P4A and P4E organizations have additional powerful features and capabilities--Multidev, Change Management, tagging, and more--in a special Organization dashboard.

Generally, individual users (who are not in an organization) don’t have access to the organization features. When a supporting organization is set up on their site, the members of the organization will continue to have the organization features available as they work on the site, however team members on the site who are not in in the organization won’t. 

###Wrap Up
As you work with the Pantheon platform, you will encounter users, sites, and organizations. You will work with sites you own and sites where you collaborate as an invited team member in My Dashboard and the Site dashboard where you’ll have everything you need to build, launch, and run a professional site. 

For larger groups of users, like those in an agency or enterprise, you can set up an organization and use the Organization dashboard’s advanced features to make working on large teams and multiple projects easier. 

Keeping these things in mind as you work on your projects will help you get the most value from Pantheon.
