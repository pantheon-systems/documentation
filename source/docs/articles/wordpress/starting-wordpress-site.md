## Create and Name Your Site

1. After you have created a Pantheon account, log into your Dashboard and click **Create your first site**.
2. Enter a name and URL, then click **Create Site**. The only valid characters are letters, numbers and dashes.

  You will then have a short wait while Pantheon creates and allocates the resources for your site's environments.

<!-- #2 -->
## Configure Your Site

You now have several options. Select **Install WordPress**, which gives you a blank site with the code pulled from a Pantheon maintained fork of the project.

<!-- #3 -->
## Site Build

Pantheon will now build your site environments and prepare your WordPress site. When complete, just click the button to visit your Pantheon Dashboard.

<!-- #4 -->
## Visit New Site Dashboard

Congratulations! Your Pantheon site environments have been configured. From the Dashboard, you can control your site's settings, manage team members, perform workflow operations, and a lot more.

<!-- #5 -->
## Launch Development Site

You will eventually have three environments (Dev, Test, and Live), each with a separate version of your website, but you need to finish development site installation first. Click **Visit Development Site** at the top left of your Dashboard to launch the site.

## Complete the Installation

Now you will add site information such as administrator username, password, and email address. Click **Continue** when done, and the installation will complete. On the login page, enter the username and password you set when configuring the site.

<!-- #7 -->
## View Your Site

You are ready to start development! Click the **Visit Development Site** button to view your Dev site at anytime.
