## Create and Name Your Site

After you have created an account, log into your Dashboard and click **Create your first site**.

Enter a name and URL, then click **Create Site**. The only valid characters are letters, numbers and dashes.

<!-- #2 -->
## Spin Up Your Site

You will then have a short wait while Pantheon creates and allocates the resources for your site's environments. This takes only a few minutes under normal circumstances.

<!-- #3 -->
## Choose Start State

You now have several options. You can start with Drupal or WordPress core, which gives you a blank site with the code pulled from a Pantheon maintained fork of the project.

Select **Install WordPress**.<br />

## Site Build

Once you've selected your start state, Pantheon will build your site environments and prepare your WordPress site.

<!-- #6 -->
## Visit New Site Dashboard

Congratulations! Your Pantheon site environments have been configured. From the dashboard, you can control your site's settings, manage team members, perform workflow operations, and a lot more.

<!-- #7 -->
## Launch Development Site

You will eventually have three environments (Development, Test, and Live), each with a separate version of your website, but you need to finish development site installation first. Click **Visit Development Site** at the top left of your dashboard to launch the site.

<!-- #8 -->
## Complete Installation

Now you will add site information such as administrator username, password, and email address. Click **Continue** when done, and the installation will complete.
​

Next you will be redirected to your login page, use the username and password you set when configuring the site.

<!-- #9 -->
## View Your Site

You are ready to start development! Click the **Visit Development Site** button to view your Dev site at anytime.
