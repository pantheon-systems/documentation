## **1. Add & Name Your Site**

After you have created an account, you can log in and will be directed to your dashboard.

![Your sites & account dashboard](https://www.getpantheon.com/sites/default/files/docs/desk_images/247520)​

Click on "Add a site." You will first be prompted to name the site. The only valid characters are letters, numbers and dashes. Enter a name and click continue.

![Pick site name](https://www.getpantheon.com/sites/default/files/docs/desk_images/247523)

## **2. Spin Up Your Site**

You will then have a short wait while Pantheon creates and allocates the resources for your site's environments. This takes only a few minutes under normal circumstances.

<!-- #3 -->
## **3. Choose Start State**

![Choose start state](https://www.getpantheon.com/sites/default/files/docs/desk_images/247526)

You now have several options. You can start with Drupal or Wordpress core, which gives you a blank site with the code pulled from a Pantheon maintained fork of the project.

Select "WordPress" and click "Continue".

<!-- #4 -->
## **4. Site is Built**

Once you've selected your start state, Pantheon will build your site environments and prepare your WordPress site.

<!-- #5 -->
## **5. Spinup Complete**

When complete, just click the button to visit your Pantheon Dashboard.

## **6. Visit New Site Dashboard**

Congratulations! Your Pantheon site environments have been configured. From the dashboard, you can control your site's settings, manage team members, perform workflow operations, and a lot more.

<!-- #7 -->
## **7. Launch Development Site**

You will eventually have three environments (development, test, and live), each with a separate version of your website, but you need to finish development site installation first. Click the link at the top left of your dashboard to launch the site.

## **8. Complete Installation**

Now you will add site information such as administrator username, password, and email address. Press “Continue” when done, and the installation will complete.
