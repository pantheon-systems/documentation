On Pantheon, adding SSL to your site is a completely self-serve option; Pantheon does not provide Private Keys or CSRs, or any SSH login for you to generate these. The key and certificates are cryptographically sensitive elements that you should not send through email, as cleartext is very insecure.

<!--You can not connect via SSH using Putty.--> These directions allow you have access without entering a password if you configure Drush or SFTP to use the keys set up by putty.  Once you've generated the CSR and Key, you can find the files to provide to your certificate provider.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <strong> Note:</strong> SSH keys include the user and hostname of the account/computer that it was generated on as a comment (in the form of "==user@usercomputer") at the end of the file. If you experience errors, see the troubleshooting section at the end of the document.</div>

Generating SSH keys is different for every platform. Please follow the directions that are most appropriate for you:

* [MacOS and Linux](/docs/articles/users/generating-ssh-keys#macos-and-linux)

* [Windows / Git GUI and OpenSSH](/docs/articles/users/generating-ssh-keys#windows-/-openssh)

	</li>-->
## MacOS and Linux

1. Open your Mac's Terminal application by going to **Applications** > **Utilities** > **Terminal**.

2. Enter the following to generate a key:

  ```
  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out www_mysite_com.csr -keyout www_mysite_com.key -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=MySite LLC/CN=www.mysite.com"
  ```

3. Unless you're an advanced user, just press ENTER for every question. If the command says the key already exists, you can either overwrite it or continue to the next step with your existing key.

4. From the Terminal, output your SSH key to a file:
  ```nohighlight
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > ~/Desktop/key_for_pantheon.txt
  ```
5. Open the key_for_pantheon.txt on your desktop, and select and copy the entire string. You're now ready to [add the key to your account](http://localhost:8000/docs/articles/users/generating-ssh-keys#add-the-key-to-your-pantheon-account).

## Windows / OpenSSH

1. [Download](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and install Git. Once you have downloaded the Git GUI installer, complete the installation using the setup wizard.

2. Click **Next** to continue.

3. Select the installation folder where you want Git installed. Unless you need to move this to another directory, leave the default path. Click **Next** to continue.

4. To have the Git GUI appear in the Start menu, set the title. Click **Next** to continue.

5. A nice feature of the Git GUI is that it can set the PATH variable for you. If you are using Cygwin you will also need the have the Cygwin Git library installed so you can access Git via the command line. Click **Next** to continue.

6. Choose option: **Checkout Windows-style...** (unless you prefer checking out with Unix line endings), and click **Next** to continue.

7. Click **Finish**.

    Voila! You are done with the installation of Git. Next you can move on the final steps of generating your SSH keys using the GUI.

8. From the Start menu, open the Git GUI, and click **Help** > **Show SSH Key**.Â 

9. You probably don't have one yet, so click **Generate Key**.

10. Enter a passphrase (optional). It doesn't have to be the same as your Pantheon password, and it will help protect your key.

11. Highlight the entire key. If it's not selected, triple-click on the text. Then click **Copy To Clipboard**.

## Add the Key to Your Pantheon Account

These instructions cover the basics, but if you need more information, see [Loading SSH Keys](/docs/articles/users/loading-ssh-keys).

![Adding SSH Keys](/source/docs/assets/images/add-ssh-key-dashboard.png)

1. Sign in to Pantheon and select **Account**.
2. Click **SSH Keys**.
3. Paste the copied key into the box, and click **Add Key** to save it.
4. Open the Git bash client, and put in the command to clone your Pantheon site. You can find this in the Dev environment of your site above the Git code log.

  If you added a password to your key, you will be prompted to enter the password for the key you created using the Git GUI tool.

## Troubleshooting

####Invalid SSH Keys
Spaces and non-standard alphanumeric characters in the user or hostname can cause an SSH key to appear invalid to Pantheon.

To fix this, edit the user or hostname and remove spaces and/or odd characters. This will not affect the key itself, as the user/hostname are simply appended as a comment for reference.

#### Control Path Error

You may receive the following error:  
`nohighlight
ControlPath too long fatal: Could not read from remote repository.`

Check your SSH config files (by default, `$HOME/.ssh/config and /etc/ssh/ssh\_config`) for a declaration like this:
```bash
Host *
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/control-%l.%r@%h:%p
```

There are two steps that you can try to fix this error. First, run:
```bash
Host *
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/control-%r
```
If this does not fix the problem, you can go a step further and add individual hosts entries, remove ControlMaster auto, and simplify the switches:
```bash
Host myapp-myname.blahblah.com
ControlPath ~/.ssh/control-%r
```
#### Server Refused to Allocate pty

This error occurs when a user is attempting to make a direct connection to Pantheon via SSH. Pantheon does not support [direct SSH connections](/docs/articles/users/generating-ssh-keys).
