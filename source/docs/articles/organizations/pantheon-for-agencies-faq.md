## Getting Started

### What is the difference between Pantheon for Agencies and Pantheon for Enterprise?

### Why does my agency organization have Change Management and Multidev, but not other organizations I administor?
Any organizations that are Partners or Allies will have Change Management and Multidev. If your organization is an Enterprise, then by default these features are not enabled. To request the activation of Pantheon for Enterprise on your organization, please [contact sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us).

### Why can't my Agency organization own a site?
Depending on your service level, your organization may or may not be able to own a site directly. Pantheon for Enterprise level organizations will be able to own sites, however Pantheon for Agencies (Partners) organizations will not. This is because an agency's role is to develop, service, and maintain a site on behalf of it's owner. See our [Change Management](/docs/articles/organizations/change-management/#managing-people) doc for more details.

### Can I add my own Agency as a Supporting Organization to a client's site?
No. At this time, it is up to the owner of the site to add your agency as a Supporting Organization. This action grants all members of the organization access to the site. You should ask site owners to add your agency as a Supporting Organization if you are providing services to the site.

### What privileges and roles are granted when adding a Supporting Organization?
All members and roles of the organization trickle down to the site. All organization members can access all sites associated with the organization.


### Can the Site Owner override privileges and access for team members of a Supporting Organization?
Yes. Roles designated on the Team page at the site level will override any roles assigned within the organization.
