Scale your agency. Pantheon for Agencies (P4A) gives you the power to manage all of your sites, people, and support tickets in one place. Land a support contract? Teaming up with another agency on a site? We’ve got you covered. Follow these instructions to get started.

## Create Your Agency Profile
Log into your Pantheon Account and navigate to https://dashboard.pantheon.io/organizations (Need an account? [Sign up for Pantheon](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/register)). Fill out the form. We ask for evidence that you have developed a few websites, and have your own presence on the web. When you’re a full partner, we’ll run that site on a Professional plan, for free.

## Invite Collaborators

Enter the email addresses of the other members of your agency, and assign them roles. Don’t worry, starting to add a third collaborator will reveal a fourth field, and so on.

## Add Sites

You’re now prompted to add existing Pantheon sites that you own to your organization. Your agency will be added to the site teams as a “Supporting Organization”

## Tour the Dashboard

Your Organization Dashboard has five tabs.

### Sites

The Sites list will now show all of the sites your agency owns or has access to as a supporting organization. All sites created with your organization selected in the dropdown will be owned by your organization, and will show here. You can quickly tag, sort and filter your sites.

### People

The People tab is where you can see all of your awesome collaborators, filter them by role, manage their roles, and add new users to your organization.

### Products

Partners and Strategic Partners can have custom upstreams from which all of their sites will be created and updated.
[Learn more](/docs/articles/organizations/running-a-custom-upstream/)

### Support

Every ticket, from every site in your org is surfaced here. You can open new tickets associated with individual sites or for your organization in general. If you spot a bug, this is the best way to tell us about it. You can also respond to tickets here.
