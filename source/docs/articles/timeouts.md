Rules are for the good of the group, and timeouts are no exception. At Pantheon, we've configured our timeouts to fit normal program execution. Sometimes, these limits can be reached when working with a particularly inefficient bit of code. In order to set expectations, the following chart describes the various user-facing timeouts on Pantheon.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I manually run Drupal cron for longer than the Pantheon executed Drupal cron?

Yes; just use <tt>drush @pantheon.SITENAME.env cron</tt> to execute cron. With that said, most slow cron executions are due to PHP errors or a slow external service. Rather than throwing more resources at an efficient process, determine why it's slow and fix the root cause.

#### Can Pantheon change the non-configurable timeouts for my site?

Sorry, no; these settings apply to every site on Pantheon. One of the factors that allows Pantheon to scale is avoiding exceptions, which includes individual process configuration.

#### Can Pantheon change the user-configurable timeouts for my site for me?

Nope, but you can in your settings.php file using the PHP functions linked in the table.

#### How can I change the Solr timeout on Drupal?

Edit the pantheon\_apachesolr module within your Drupal site installation and enjoy your voided warranty (we can't support user modifications). Seriously, this treats a symptom and not the problem; you should reduce the batch size instead and avoid indexing large binary files.
