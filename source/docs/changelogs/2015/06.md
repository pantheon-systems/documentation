##Platform Improvements

**Webinars**  
Tired of typing support requests on how to use the platform? No question is ignored on our [Essential Technical Training Webinar](https://pantheon.io/resources/june-training-build-drupal-and-wordpress-sites-pantheon), which will be held weekly  starting on Thursday, June 18, at 10:00 a.m. PST. [Register here](https://pantheon.io/resources/june-training-build-drupal-and-wordpress-sites-pantheon). Let your team know this resource is always available.

**Dashboard Load Times**  
We've been optimizing Dashboard load times, specifically for the Site Dashboard. Things are looking much better. Have you noticed a difference? We'd love to hear your feedback. What is the WORST thing about using Pantheon?

**Free Backups**
Not on Pantheon? Get a free Drupal cloud backup! Learn more about the NodeSquirrel acquisition in [Zack's blog post](https://pantheon.io/blog/why-pantheon-bought-nodesquirrel).

**Barrel Roll Reboots**
We did an emergency reboot of all servers during DrupalCon to install a patch for the [Venom security vulnerability](http://venom.crowdstrike.com/).
