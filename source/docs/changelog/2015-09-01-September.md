## September Platform Improvements


**Pantheon Enterprise is Now Available**  
We released [Pantheon Enterprise](https://pantheon.io/blog/announcing-pantheon-enterprise), our flagship product for managing multiple sites. It’s included in Elite (formerly Enterprise) site plans, or you can add it as a standalone product and get access to Multidev, Change Management, SAML, and more. 

**Terminus 0.8.0**  
Our applications team released [Terminus versions through 0.8.1](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#081---2015-09-28) -- a faster, more consistent CLI which is more friendly to advanced scripting. Expect 1.0 soon! 

**Login Destination**  
If you’re a member of an Organization or Agency, you can now set your default login location to your user Dashboard or your Organization Dashboard. [Change your default](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/user/#account/login-destination) now.
