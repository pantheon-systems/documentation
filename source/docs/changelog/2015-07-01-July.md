##Platform Improvements

**WordPress 4.2.3 is Live**  
WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a security release for all previous versions to protect against a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. Read Josh’s post recapping the ways we save users from automatic updates breaking their sites. 

**Multidev UI Updated**     
The Multidev Dashboard now provides a progress bar after the environment creation modal disappears.

**Scripts to Quickly Make a Drupal 7 Project Using Composer**     
Greg Anderson created scripts and example repos to automate your builds using a composer-based workflow. Check out [CI scripts](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/circle-scripts), [Travis CI scripts](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/travis-scripts), and [this exciting pull request](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/pull/65) in our Drops-7 repository. 

**Kalabox 2 <3 Pantheon**    
Kalabox 2 now supports quickly pulling and pushing apps between Pantheon and your local Kalabox. [Read how at Github](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/wiki/Pantheon-Guide).
