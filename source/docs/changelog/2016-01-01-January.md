## Platform Improvements

**Machine Token Authentication**  
You can now authenticate with Terminus using machine tokens! This means usernames and passwords are no longer required to use the command line. [Create yours now](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/users/#account/tokens/). 

**Pantheon HUD Plugin**  
We released the [Pantheon HUD plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-hud/). This plugin will:   
- Remind you what environment you're in and let you jump to the others  
- Show some status data about the environment  
- Give you a copy/paste Terminus WP-CLI command starter    
A big thanks to Daniel Bachhuber (of WP-CLI fame) for putting this together. Development is taking place on [Github](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-hud/), and as always your pull requests and issues with feature ideas are welcome! 

**Quicksilver Platform Hooks Are Now Available**  
* Quicksilver opens up our platform and allows deeper integration and automation by adding hooks for encoding reactions to specific platform workflows. Common uses so far include:
* Automatically sanitizing databases after cloning content from Live
* Marking deployments in New Relic to track improvements or regressions
* Posting notifications to Slack of platform actions  
[Learn more about Quicksilver](https://pantheon.io/docs/articles/sites/quicksilver/) or check out the examples on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples).

**Terminus 0.10.2 Released**  
If you haven't updated in a while, check out the [Terminus Changelog](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and get the [latest version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/releases). This release includes some new commands like site redis enable and site solr enable.
