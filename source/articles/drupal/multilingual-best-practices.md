Pantheon is home to many polylingual and non-English sites, and hosting a multi-language site on Pantheon requires no additional platform configuration.  

For detailed information on how to configure a multilingual Drupal site, see the [Multilingual Guide on Drupal.org](https://drupal.org/documentation/multilingual).  


Pantheon doesn’t enforce any particular site layout or architecture for multilingual sites, but the blog entry  [Working with multi-regional websites](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/03/working-with-multi-regional-websites.html) from The Google Webmaster Central Blog has some fantastic recommendations.  
It’s possible to specify a site language given a particular domain or path. In order of preference:

1. ccTLDs (country-code top level domain names)
2. Subdomains with gTLDs eg: de.site.com, fr.site.com, etc.
3. Subdirectories with gTLDs eg: site.com/de/, site.com/fr/, etc.

Each of these configurations is possible with Drupal’s built-in language switching.  

You can associate multiple domains with a single site environment. See [adding a domain to a site environment](/documentation/getting-started/adding-a-domain-to-a-site-environment/) for details.  


Pantheon does not include any geolocation libraries. If you’d like to automatically direct traffic to a particular domain or path, check out [Geolocation and IP detection with SSL using JavaScript](/documentation/advanced-topics/geolocation-and-ip-detection-with-ssl-using-javascript/-geolocation-and-ip-detection-with-ssl-using-javascript).  


If you have a particular Pantheon platform related question that is not addressed in this document, please submit a support ticket through your Pantheon dashboard and we’ll be happy to help.
