### **1. Add & Name your site**

After you have created an account, you can log in and will be directed to your dashboard.

![Your sites & account dashboard](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/247520)​

Click on "Add a site." You will first be prompted to name the site. The only valid characters are letters, numbers and dashes. Enter a name and click continue.

### **2. Spin up your site**

You will then have a short wait while Pantheon creates and allocates the resources for your site's environments. This takes only a few minutes under normal circumstances.

<!-- #3 -->
### **3. Choose start state**

![Choose start state](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/247526)

You now have several options. You can start with Drupal or Wordpress core, which gives you a blank site with the code pulled from a Pantheon maintained fork of the project.

Select "WordPress" and click "Continue".

<!-- #4 -->
### **4. Relax while we magically configure**

Once you've selected your start state, Pantheon will build your site environments and prepare your WordPress site.

<!-- #5 -->
### **5. Spinup Complete**

When complete, just click the button to visit your Pantheon Dashboard.

### **6. Visit new site dashboard**

Congratulations! Your Pantheon site environments have been configured. From the dashboard, you can control your site's settings, manage team members, perform workflow operations, and a lot more.

<!-- #7 -->
### **7. Launch development site**

You will eventually have three environments (development, test, and live), each with a separate version of your website, but you need to finish development site installation first. Click the link at the top left of your dashboard to launch the site.

### **8. Complete Installation**

Now you will add site information such as administrator username, password, and email address. Press “Continue” when done, and the installation will complete.

Next you will be redirected to your login page, use the username and password you set when configuring the site.
