## Overview
Welcome to Pantheon! In a few simple steps, your Drupal or WordPress site will be up and running faster than ever. Use this checklist to get the most out of the platform.

 

## 1. Create Your Free Account

Visit [https://www.getpantheon.com](https://www.getpantheon.com) and click  the "Create Your Free Account" button in the header.

## 2. Verify Your Email Address

Once you submit your account information, you will be taken to the Pantheon Dashboard.

Before you can create a site, you'll need to verify your email by clicking a one-time verification link sent to the email you specified.  


 ![](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/180004)

If you don't see the email immediately, check your spam folder. If you still haven't received it after 15 minutes, click the resend verification link from the dashboard, or contact support by submitting a ticket.

## 3. Create a Site

Once your email is verified, you can create your first site. See our article  [launching your first site](/documentation/getting-started/creating-your-first-site/) for more detailed documentation.  


Start by clicking the "Create a site now" link.

Then, enter a name for your Pantheon site. You can change the human readable name for the site, but the site development URL is permanent and cannot be changed.

## Start From Scratch

If you want to develop directly on Pantheon, you can start with one of the many distributions available on the platform. For more details, see [choosing your start state](/documentation/getting-started/choosing-your-start-state/-choosing-your-start-state#starting-with-a-Drupal-product).

![](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/180017)

## Import Manually

If you have an existing site that you want to import, choose "Import manually". For additional details, see [importing an existing site](/documentation/advanced-topics/importing-an-existing-drupal-site-to-pantheon/-importing-an-existing-site).

## 4. Interact With Your Code

There are two ways to add and update your site's code; via Git source code management and SFTP.

#### Git Connection Mode

Git is a well-known, industry standard revision control system for managing site code. For more information, see [starting with git](/documentation/getting-started/starting-with-git/-starting-with-git).  
 ![](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/180025)  
To use Git, you'll need to go to your dashboard and add a public SSH key.

For detailed instructions, see the article [generating SSH keys](/documentation/howto/generating-ssh-keys/).

#### SFTP Connection Mode
You can develop directly on the server using SFTP mode. See [enabling SFTP mode](/documentation/getting-started/developing-on-pantheon-directly-with-sftp-mode/) for details.

## 5. Credentials on Pantheon

Your getpantheon.com username and password is only used to access your dashboard for managing sites and submitting support tickets. Any users on your Pantheon hosted Drupal sites will be distinct; there is no single sign-on between getpantheon.com and your Drupal or WordPress site, and Pantheon does not manage your users.  

There are a number of credentials available for developers; each of which can be found in the dashboard. For details, see the following articles:

- [rsync and SFTP](/documentation/advanced-topics/rsync-and-sftp/-rsync-and-sftp)
- [Starting with Git](/documentation/getting-started/starting-with-git/)
- [Accessing MySQL databases](/documentation/advanced-topics/accessing-mysql-databases/)
- [Redis as a caching backend](/documentation/howto/redis-as-a-caching-backend/-redis)

## 6. Learn About the Pantheon Workflow

Familiarize yourself with the [Pantheon Workflow](/documentation/howto/using-the-pantheon-workflow/), both for code deployment and content (database and files).

## 7. Learn More About the Pantheon Platform

To gain a better understanding of how the Pantheon system architecture works, see [all about DROPs](/documentation/advanced-topics/all-about-application-containers/).

## 8. Known Limitations

No platform is perfect; familiarize yourself with Pantheon's  [known limitations](/documentation/running-drupal/known-limitations/-known-limitations) now and save yourself the headache later on!

## 9. Prepare for Launch by Adding a Credit Card

When you're ready to launch your site, you'll need to add a credit card to the site. For details, see:

- [Adding a Card to a Specific Site.](/documentation/howto/add-a-credit-card-to-a-site/-add-a-credit-card-to-a-site)

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Does Pantheon offer professional services?

Pantheon does not provide development, module, or site building as a service, so we can not write code or develop the sites for you. There are a number of development firms and skilled contractors who are available if you do not have a developer available. See the [Pantheon Partner Directory](https://www.getpantheon.com/partners) for more information.

If you're seeking an individual developer, there are a number of resources available to help you through this process. [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org/) has some comprehensive documentation about [working with service providers](http://drupal.org/node/51169), including:

- [Individuals who provide services](http://drupal.org/profile/profile_drupal_services)
- [Marketplace of Service providers](http://drupal.org/drupal-services)
- [Mailing List for Drupal consultants](http://lists.drupal.org/mailman/listinfo/consulting)

#### Does Pantheon offer enterprise support?

Pantheon provides a guided launch concierge to Enterprise customers during both migration and development on Pantheon. We can work directly with your stakeholders and development team to optimize and prepare your site for launch, identifying and eliminating platform issues. 24/7 emergency support is also available post-launch.
