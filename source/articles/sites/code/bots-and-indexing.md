Bots are part of every public-facing website's lifecycle. We wouldn't be able to find a thing on the internet without them! Bots perform the hard work taken for granted when browsing the multitudes of indexed search results from any given search engine. In the wrong hands, bots can become nagging nuisances slowing down or even taking down your site. As a web developer or admin, knowing how to handle bots comes with the territory.

## Bots in my Logs: Real World Scenarios and Identifiers

Bots don't browse like humans. Analyzing access patterns in the Nginx log is one of the quickest ways to determine the presence of bots.

### Rapid fire requests and/or duplicates.

###  

In the log snippet below, there are multiple requests coming in for the same path in rapid fire succession. The time stamp reflects 5 identical requests at the same milisecond. Requests of this nature should be investigated.

### Bots Converging on Erroring Pages

Some legitimate [bots/crawlers/proxies](http://www.httpuseragent.org/list/) (such as BingBot or AdsBotGoogle) will identify themselves. Since search-indexing is desirable for most sites, tread carefully in order to avoid wreaking havoc on a site's SEO. That said, there may be instances in which crawlers/spiders converge on a page that is erroring out ( [502s](/documentation/getting-started/errors-and-server-responses/-errors-and-server-responses) in the example below). These repetitive requests can exasperate the pageload issues by putting more load on the server. These errors should be investigated immediately. When the error has been fixed, the bots/crawlers should crawl on their merry way and will no longer be hung-up on the give path.

## Robots.txt: Indexing Your Pantheon Site

It is important to note that each of your site environments have a robots.txt associated with the bare ".gotpantheon.com" domain that contains the following:

    User-agent: * Disallow: /

The gotpantheon domains are ONLY intended for development use and cannot be used for production. If you're testing links or SEO prior to launch, a workaround may be to assign a test or beta domain to an environment and test your links following the alternative domain. In addition, if you run SEO toolsets locally, you could possibly utilize a /etc/hosts file entry on your local development box to spoof your production domain on Pantheon.

You can index your site under your production domain. There are many contrib module options available for creating sitemaps, including [XMLSiteMap](https://drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap) and [Site\_Map](https://drupal.org/project/site_map). It is up to you to configure the module to work as you desire. Pantheon does not offer support for contrib modules.

The following code snippet will redirect any bots trying index using the sitemap of a gotpantheon domain and redirect it to your custom domain. Please replace the URL's to reflect your domain. You can place this in Settings.php.

    // Redirect to force indexing with custom domain sitemap
    $subject = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
    $pattern = '/gotpantheon.com/sitemap.xml$/';
    preg_match($pattern, $subject, $matches);
    $counted = count($matches);
    if ($counted > 0 ) {
        header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
        header('Location: http://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml'. $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
        exit();
    }
