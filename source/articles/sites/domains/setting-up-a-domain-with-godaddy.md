#### Choose your domain name
When you have searched for your domain name you can go ahead and add it to your cart. It is important to note that if you purchase more than one domain that you will be required to configure the A records or CNAME for each one.

#### Activate your Domain (Optional)
In the event that you need to get email setup to work with your new domain you can select the option that works for you. Pantheon does not provide email hosting services so you will need to make sure to look at the option that best suits your needs.

#### Setting up the Zone Record
The last step on Godaddy is to make sure you have correctly setup your A record or CNAME for your domain. Make sure you have put in the I.P. address or the CNAME to point your domain to Pantheon. You can get more information about this on our [Going Live](/documentation/running-drupal/going-live-and-launching-your-site/-going-live) documentation page. 


**Note: If you have SSL enabled on your site, you have been given a unique I.P. address. This is the I.P. that you should point the A record to.**

##### Add you domain to Pantheon

The final step is logging in to your site's dashboard and going to the Live environment's tab. Proceed by clicking the "Edit" button and enter you custom domain name for you site.
