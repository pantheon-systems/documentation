Every free Pantheon development site comes ready to roll with SSL for development. Simply switch your connection method to HTTPS and your `dev-yoursite.gotpantheon.com` domain will work.

**Note** : older sites with domain names like `dev.mysite.gotpantheon.com` (a dot rather than a dash in the prefix) can benefit from being reset to use the new style. This will prevent SSL warnings. Contact support if you have an older-style domain name and would like it to be reformatted.

For more information on managing redirection to HTTPS, see [redirecting incoming requests](/documentation/howto/redirect-incoming-requests/).
