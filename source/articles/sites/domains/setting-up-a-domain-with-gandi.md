This article assumes that you have already purchased a domain from Gandi.

#### Setting up the Zone Record

In order to get your domain resolving to your Pantheon site, you will need to edit and associate a Zone Record with the domain in the Gandi domain administration panel.

First, navigate to the DNS Zones panel by clicking on the "DNS ZONES" button above the domains list.

From the Zones panel, select the file that you will use for your domain. If one does not yet exist, create a new Zone file.

Click the Zone file in the list to start editing.

Change the editing mode to Expert in the dropdown menu on the right.

**NOTICE: If you are editing a pre-existing Zone file, you will receive a notice (see image below, the notice is highlighted) that tells you that the zone file is currently being used and you will need to create a new version.**

**![Configure the A records](https://pantheon-systems.desk.com/customer/portal/attachments/197261)**

**The zone configuration in the above example is as folllows:**

    pantheonsupport.com 10800 IN A 192.237.142.203
    www 10800 IN CNAME pantheonsupport.com

Â 

**In line 1, we have an A Record in place for our bare domain (ie "pantheonsupport.com"):**

    pantheonsupport.com 10800 IN A 192.237.142.203

**In line 2, we have a CNAME in place to accomodate 'www':**

    www 10800 IN CNAME pantheonsupport.com

**When you have entered your configuration (and double-checked that it is correct twice!), click the 'Use Version' button. If you've followed the steps in this article, your DNS configuration for your new domain is now complete on the Gandi end.**

##### **Add Your Domain to Pantheon**

**In order for your domain to resolve to your Pantheon site, it will need to be added to your sites Pantheon dashboard. This [helpdesk article](/documentation/running-drupal/going-live-and-launching-your-site/-going-live-and-launching-your-site#setting-up-a-domain-with-Pantheon) will walk you through the process.**
