### 1. Create a New Site

On your user dashboard, click  **Create your first site** or **Create a new site** .

### 2. Name Your Site

Choose a name for your site. You cannot change the name of a site after creating it. A development URL will be automatically generated for you, at our pantheon.io domain.

### 3. Choose Your Framework

Click **Install WordPress**  or **Install Drupal**  or any of the distributions available on the Platform.

### 4. Visit the Dev Installation

On the Site Dashboard, click **Visit Development Site** to open the development environment.  You'll then be prompted to complete the Drupal or Wordpress installation forms.  

To start adding code or themes, start  with the SFTP connection, or toggle to Git mode to start cloning and pushing.

### Free Sites

Free sites are useful for trying out the Pantheon platform, creating sandboxes for development, or for starting a new client project. We allocate two free sandbox sites for all user accounts. When one of your sites converts to a paid plan, you can start another sandbox site. If you need additional development sites, contact us and we'll be happy to work with you.

### Your Pantheon Account

Your account is your own individual account, and every account can manage multiple projects (or sites) at a time. Pantheon doesn't recommend sharing your account with other people. If you're collaborating on a project or handing over ownership to a client, use our  team management and ownership transfer tools.
