Completely deleting your Pantheon account requires three major steps.

### 1. Backup & Export Your Sites

The first thing to do is to backup and export your sites. Yes, you are leaving the platform, but you should always have a backup of your work just in case.

If you need to make a backup of an existing environment, check out the related article [in the wiki](/documentation/getting-started/backup-creation/-creating-a-backup).

For more information about exporting a backup of an environment, see the [Restoring a Backup](/documentation/howto/restoring-an-environment-from-a-backup/-restoring-an-environment-from-a-backup) document.

### 2. Delete Each of Your Sites

Once you have backed-up your data and are ready to delete your sites, see the [Deleting a Site](/documentation/howto/deleting-a-site-on-pantheon/-deleting-a-site-on-pantheon) document in the wiki. It is a simple one-click operation, but it is **_permanent_** . Don't worry. You will be prompted to confirm before the deletion occurs.

### 3. Delete Your Credit Cards

The next step is to delete the associated credit cards. For more information, see the [Removing a Credit Card](/documentation/howto/removing-a-credit-card/-removing-a-credit-card) document.

### 4. Submit a Final Support Request

In order to completely delete your account from our system, please open a support request using the email address you wish deleted. The process currently requires manual action and will be completed within 30 days.
