The platform resources and features provided to your website depend on your current plan. Pantheon can scale instantly, so changing your service level will immediately change your resources to the values for the new plan, as shown in the table below.

## Calculate Concurrent User / Dynamic Page Capacity

One common need in determining a plan level is calculating the amount of concurrent traffic a site can handle, especially when all or some of the traffic cannot be handled by caching.

The first thing you must know is how fast your site responds to dynamic (uncached) page requests. Take the product of your containers and concurrency, and divide by that value to give you your max dynamic requests per second:

`Containers * Concurrency / Average Page Response = Dynamic Capacity`

So on a Personal plan, if your site responds in 750ms on average, your dynamic capacity would be about 5 requests per second:

`1 * 4 / 0.75 = 5.333`

Calculating what this means for logged in users can be done by making a "time between clicks" estimate so you can understand how many requests per second the average user generates.

`Containers * Concurrency / Average Page Response * Time Between Clicks = User Capacity`

The amount of time between users clicking (i.e. how frequently they need a new page) will vary a lot depending on your use case, but it's important to make an estimate.

Example:  
If you're running an interactive user forum on a Business plan, you've tuned your site and know that your average backend response time is around 1500ms. You also know that broadly speaking the average user clicks a new link once every 20 seconds. Using this formula tells you that your Business plan should max out at around 200 concurrent users:

`20 / 1.5 * 2 * 8 = 213`

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### Are these the complete specs and memory for my site?
There are many "under the hood" configuration values not show here, but these are the most important values for understanding whether or not Pantheon will fit for a given site.

#### Is memory shared between containers?
No, your database and application container resources are not shared. They operate in their own Linux user space with their own memory.

#### Are the specs the same for all three environments (Dev/Test/Live)?  
Yes they have the same infrastructure; however, Business plans and above have multiple application containers, while Dev and Test environments have only one.
