Configure redirects within `settings.php` (Drupal) or `wp-config.php` (WordPress), adjusting placeholder values within snippets as needed (e.g., `example.com`).

## Considerations
### PHP vs htaccess
Pantheon does not support managing redirects in `.htaccess` files, since they are ignored by [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/#){.external} for reduced resource consumption and increased efficiency. This configuration is standard across all Pantheon sites, and modifications to the `nginx.conf` file are not supported.

Using `.htaccess` is generally not recommended - even for sites running  [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/howto/htaccess.html#when){.external}. Instead, we suggest handling redirects in PHP within your site's configuration file. Some advantages of redirecting via PHP instead of `.htaccess` include:

- Logic and decisions can be made that a web server would have no context for, as it's executable code with application state awareness. Conditional logic, regular expressions, and much more are possible.
- Configuration tends to be more maintainable as Drupal and WordPress developers are typically more familiar with PHP than Apache rewrite rules.
- Since `settings.php` and `wp-config.php` are parsed very early in the bootstrap process, redirects like this are "cheap" with low overhead. If you use a 301 redirect, the [Pantheon Global CDN](/docs/global-cdn/) will cache it as well.

### Avoid Excessive Redirects
When using multiple snippets, be sure to step through the logic. This is particularly important when redirecting to a common domain while also incorporating redirects for specific pages. All `if` conditional statements need to be in the correct order. For example, a wholesale redirect executed *prior* to redirects for specific pages would likely prevent the second statement from being evaluated.

## Redirect to HTTPS and the Primary Domain
This redirect is considered best practice and recommended as part of the going live procedure. Configure this redirect after connecting a custom domain in the Site Dashboard when you're ready to launch the site. For details, see [Launch Essentials](/docs/guides/launch/).

The following configuration will redirect HTTP to HTTPS _and_ enforce use of a primary domain, such as `http://live-site-name.pantheonsite.io` to `https://www.example.com` or `http://example.com` to `https://www.example.com`:

## Additional Redirects (Optional)
Implement scenario specific redirects as required by the site. Depending on the needs of the site, you may only need one, some, or none of the following.
### Redirect to HTTPS
The following configuration will redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, such as `http://env-site-name.pantheonsite.io` to `https://env-site-name.pantheonsite.io`:

```php
// Require HTTPS across all Pantheon environments
// Check if Drupal or WordPress is running via command line
if (isset($_SERVER['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']) && ($_SERVER['HTTPS'] === 'OFF') && (php_sapi_name() != "cli")) {
  if (!isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT_HTTPS']) || (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT_HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT_HTTPS'] != 'ON')) {

    header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
    header('Location: https://'. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
    exit();

    # Name transaction "redirect" in New Relic for improved reporting (optional)
    if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) {
      newrelic_name_transaction("redirect");
    }
  }
}
```

### Redirect from Subdomain to Subdirectory Path
The following configuration will redirect requests for `subdomain.example.com` to `https://example.com/subdirectory/`:

```php
// Redirect subdomain to a specific path.
// Check if Drupal or WordPress is running via command line
if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']) && ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] == 'subdomain.example.com') && (php_sapi_name() != "cli")) {
  $newurl = 'https://www.example.com/subdirectory/'. $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
  header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
  header("Location: $newurl");
  exit();

  # Name transaction "redirect" in New Relic for improved reporting (optional)
  if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) {
    newrelic_name_transaction("redirect");
  }
}
```

### Redirect One Path to Another
The following configuration will redirect requests for `example.com/old` to `https://example.com/new`:

```php
// 301 Redirect from /old to /new
// Check if Drupal or WordPress is running via command line
if (($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] == '/old') && (php_sapi_name() != "cli")) {
  header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
  header('Location: https://'. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/new');
  exit();

  # Name transaction "redirect" in New Relic for improved reporting (optional)
  if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) {
    newrelic_name_transaction("redirect");
  }
}
```
### Redirect Multiple Paths
The following configuration will redirect requests for `example.com`, `example.com/old`, `example.com/another/path`, and  `example.com/old-path` to `https://example.com/new-path-for-all`:

```php
$redirects = array(
  "/",
  "/old",
  "/another/path",
  "/old-path");

// 301 Redirect from multiple paths
// Check if Drupal or WordPress is running via command line
if ((in_array($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $redirects)) && (php_sapi_name() != "cli")) {
  header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
  header('Location: https://'. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/new-path-for-all');
  exit();

  # Name transaction "redirect" in New Relic for improved reporting (optional)
  if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) {
    newrelic_name_transaction("redirect");
  }
}
```

### Redirect Multiple Subdomains
The following configuration will redirect requests for `sub1.example.com`, `sub2.example.com`, `sub3.example.com`, and `sub4.example.com` to `https://new.example.com`:

```php
// Redirect multiple subdomains to a single domain.
// Check if Drupal or WordPress is running via command line
if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']) && ($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] === 'live') && (php_sapi_name() != "cli")) {
  if (in_array($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], array(
    'sub1.example.com',
    'sub2.example.com',
    'sub3.example.com',
    'sub4.example.com'
  ))) {
    header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
    header('Location: https://new.example.com'. $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
    exit();

    # Name transaction "redirect" in New Relic for improved reporting (optional)
    if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) {
      newrelic_name_transaction("redirect");
    }
  }
}
```

### Redirect Legacy UNIX-Style User Home Folder Paths
When transitioning from a system that used a tilde to indicate a home directory, the syntax is slightly different. Here's how you can parse out the username and relative path that the request was made for:

```php
$request_parts = explode('/', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
$legacy_username = $legacy_path = '';
if (isset($request_parts[1]) && strpos($request_parts[1], '~') === 0) {
  $legacy_username = substr($request_parts[1], 1);
  // If FALSE, then the request was just to the username.
  $legacy_path = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], (strlen($request_parts[1]) + 1));
}
if ($legacy_username) {
  // Your custom logic.
}
```

### Redirect to Force Lowercase Letters
<!-- Nav tabs -->
<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <!-- Active tab -->
  <li id="tab-1-id" role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#tab-1-anchor" aria-controls="tab-1-anchor" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">WordPress</a></li>

  <!-- 2nd Tab Nav -->
  <li id="tab-2-id" role="presentation"><a href="#tab-2-anchor" aria-controls="tab-2-anchor" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- Tab panes -->
<div class="tab-content">
  <!-- Active pane content -->
  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="tab-1-anchor" markdown="1">
  WordPress automatically forces lowercase letters within URLs using the [`sanitize_title_with_dashes()`](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.6/src/wp-includes/formatting.php#L1744){.external} function in core.
  </div>

  <!-- 2nd pane content -->
  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="tab-2-anchor" markdown="1">
  Drupal sites can force lowercase letters using the following:

  1. Set general automatic alias settings to **Change to lower case** within the [PathAuto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto){.external} module configuration (`/admin/build/path/pathauto`).
  2. Enable **Case Sensitive URL Checking** within the [Global Redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/globalredirect){.external} module configuration (`/admin/settings/globalredirect`).
