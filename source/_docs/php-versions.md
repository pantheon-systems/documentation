Upgrading your site's PHP version will improve the security, performance, and supportability of your site. See our blog post for an [example of 62% performance gains after upgrading](https://pantheon.io/blog/php-7-now-available-all-sites-pantheon).

## Verify Current PHP Versions
Verify current PHP settings from the Site Dashboard by clicking **Settings** > **PHP version**.

## Configure PHP Version
Manage PHP versions by committing a `pantheon.yml` configuration file to the root of your site's code repository. Your `pantheon.yml` file will look like the following:

```yaml
api_version: 1

php_version: 7.0
```

Now your site’s PHP version is managed via `pantheon.yml`, so it’s in version control and deployed along with the rest of your code.


### Available PHP Versions
Available PHP versions are 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, and 7.0.

## Resolve PHP Version Compatibility Issues

We recommend working with theme, module, or plugin maintainers to resolve any issues upstream. For custom code, see the Backward Incompatible Changes documentation in the [PHP Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/appendices.php) for migrating from one PHP version to another.

## Troubleshooting

### Upgrading PHP Version May Require Upgrading Drush Versions

If you see errors on the Pantheon Dashboard when trying to auto-run `update.php`, for example, upgrading Drush should resolve the issue. For more information, see [Manage Drush Versions on Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/docs/drush-versions/#modifying-default-drush-version).
