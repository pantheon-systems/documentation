By default, Pantheon runs Drush 8.x on newly created Drupal sites and 5.x on sites created prior to November 4, 2015. When running Drush locally, we highly recommend running Drush version 8.x, although 7.x is also supported. Alias files generated by Pantheon are not compatible with 6.x; however, you can execute commands locally with this version by including the `--strict=0` option.

## Terminus Drush and Local Drush
[Terminus](/docs/terminus/) makes remote Drush calls on sites without using a local installation, eliminating compatibility issues between local and remote installs. For more information, see our guide on [Managing Drupal Sites with Terminus and Drush](/docs/guides/terminus-drupal-site-management/).

## Modifying Default Drush Version
You can change a site's Drush version on Pantheon via [Terminus](/docs/terminus/):

```
$ terminus site set-drush-version --version=[5|7|8]
```
