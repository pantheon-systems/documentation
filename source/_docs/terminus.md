Our command line interface, Terminus, provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do almost everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, and much more.

<a href="/docs/terminus/install">Install Terminus</a> for Linux / Mac OSX or Windows.

## Using Terminus

You can use Terminus to perform all of the operations you do on the Dashboard, including:  

- Creating a new site
- Creating and deleting Multidev environments
- Cloning one environment to another
- Checking for upstream updates
- Deploying code

## Contribute
Terminus is open source! View the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus) to contribute, file issues, and submit feature requests.

## Clearing Redis Cache
Terminus 1.0 does not include the clear option available in earlier versions. To clear your Redis cache, use the dashboard or [the Redis command-line client](https://pantheon.io/docs/redis/#clear-cache).
