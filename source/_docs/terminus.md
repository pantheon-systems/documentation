Our command line interface, Terminus, provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do almost everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, and much more.

<a href="/docs/terminus/install">Install Terminus</a> on Mac OS X or Linux, or on Windows using [Git BASH on Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). For details on legacy versions of Terminus, see [Legacy Terminus Versions](/docs/terminus/get-started/legacy).
