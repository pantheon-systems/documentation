Penetration testing is a method of testing site security by probing to find potential vulnerabilities that might be taken advantage of by external attackers. Vulnerability scans are run on an IP address and scan for known security vulnerabilities, such as missing patches and updates, to help you identify potential risks. 

## Planning Penetration Tests on a Pantheon Site

Penetration testing and vulnerability scans are provided by an external company and not from Pantheon. If you have HTTPS enabled on your site, have an Elite site with a load balancer, or use a CDN such as CloudFlare, [open a support ticket](https://dashboard.pantheon.io#support/open-ticket) with the following information:

 - Domain(s) to be scanned
 - Approximate dates and times of the scan
 - Name of the company performing the scan
 - Name and contact information for the person who can halt the scan

This helps us provide the best support we can for your security initiative.

 <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
 <h4>Note</h4>
 If your site is not on a load balancer, you must limit your scan to ports 80 and 443. </div>

## Penetration Test Results
If anything comes back flagged after testing, please contact Support to discuss the results of your tests.
