## Cloning a WordPress Site
After selecting **[Migrate Existing Site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/migrate/)**, you'll create a new Pantheon site and install the Pantheon Migrations plugin on your existing Pantheon site. Visit the plugin settings and paste in your newly created Pantheon site name, as well as the machine token we generate for you, which gives the plugin access to move data to your new Pantheon site.

See exactly how cloning works in the following video:

## Cloning a Drupal Site
After selecting **[Migrate Existing Site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/migrate/)**, you'll create a new Pantheon site. During the **Create Site Archive** step of the migration process, use [Terminus](/docs/terminus) to create an archive of your existing Pantheon site:

```bash
terminus drush 'ard --destination=code/sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz'
```

This operation writes the archive to Pantheon's filesystem in a web accessible location (e.g. `http://env-site-name.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz`). Click **Continue Migration** and follow all remaining instructions within the guided migration process.

### Troubleshooting
If your archive is larger than 256MB the operation will fail, resulting in the following error:

```bash
Connection to appserver.<ENV>.<Site UUID>.drush.in closed by remote host.
```

If your database and code compressed are less than 256MB you can exclude the files directory from export using the following steps, otherwise [manually migrate](/docs/migrate-manual) the site.

<ol><li>Use <a href="/docs/terminus">Terminus</a> and the <code>--tar-options</code> flag:<br><br>
<pre><code class="bash hljs">terminus drush <span class="hljs-string">'ard <b>--tar-options="--exclude=code/sites/default/files"</b> --destination=code/sites/default/files/&lt;RANDOM_HASH&gt;.tgz'</span></code></pre></li></ol>

2. Click **Continue Migration**.
3. Provide the web accessible URL for your site archive (e.g. `http://env-site-name.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz`) and select **Import Archive**.
4. Once the migration is complete, click **Visit the Site Dashboard**.
5. Open a new tab and go to the Site Dashboard for your existing Pantheon site.
6. Within the target environment (typically Live), select the **Backups** tab and click **Create New Backup**.
7. Click the down arrow next to Files and copy the link to your offsite backup.
8. Switch back to the Site Dashboard for your new Pantheon site and go to **Database / Files** > **Import**.
<ol start="9"><li>Paste the URL to your file archive and click <b>Import</b>.
 <div class="alert alert-info">
 <h4>Note</h4>
 URL Imports have a file size limit of 500MB. If your import fails, download the backup, decompress contents locally, and <a href="/docs/rsync-and-sftp">upload your files directly using rsync or SFTP</a>.
 </div>
</li></ol>
