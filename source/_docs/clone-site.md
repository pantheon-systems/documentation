## WordPress
After selecting **[Migrate Existing Site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/migrate/)**, you'll create a new Pantheon site and install the Pantheon Migrations plugin on your existing Pantheon site. Visit the plugin settings and paste in your newly created Pantheon site name, as well as the machine token we generate for you, which gives the plugin access to move data to your new Pantheon site.

See exactly how it works in the following video:

## Drupal
After selecting **[Migrate Existing Site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/migrate/)**, you'll create a new Pantheon site. During the **Create Site Archive** step of the migration process, use [Terminus](/docs/terminus) to create an archive of your existing Pantheon site:

```bash
terminus drush <site>.<env> -- ard --destination=code/sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz
```

This operation writes the archive to Pantheon's filesystem in a web accessible location (e.g. `https://env-site-name.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz`). In this example, `<RANDOM_HASH>` is any long string. On Mac and Linux systems, you can use `openssl rand -hex 20` to generate a 20 character hexidecimal hash.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p markdown="1">We reccomend using a random hash for the archive filename for security. Archive dumps contain sensitive information, so they should not be exposed using guessable filename patterns (like `BACKUP` or recent dates). We also advise prompt removal of archive files once you've completed the migration.</p>
</div>

Click **Continue Migration** and follow all remaining instructions within the guided migration process.

### Troubleshooting

#### Connection was closed by remote host

If your archive is larger than 256MB the operation will fail, resulting in the following error:

```bash
Connection to appserver.<ENV>.<Site UUID>.drush.in closed by remote host.
```

If your database and code compressed are less than 256MB you can exclude the files directory from export using the following steps, otherwise [manually migrate](/docs/migrate-manual) the site.

1. Use [Terminus](/docs/terminus) and the `--tar-options` flag:

        terminus drush <site>.<env> ard --tar-options="--exclude=code/sites/default/files" --destination=sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz

2. Click **Continue Migration**.
3. Provide the web accessible URL for your site archive (e.g. `https://env-site-name.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/<RANDOM_HASH>.tgz`) and select **Import Archive**.
4. Once the migration is complete, click **Visit the Site Dashboard**.
5. Open a new tab and go to the Site Dashboard for your existing Pantheon site.
6. Within the target environment (typically Live), select the **Backups** tab and click **Create New Backup**.
7. Click the down arrow next to Files and copy the link to your offsite backup.
8. Switch back to the Site Dashboard for your new Pantheon site and go to **Database / Files** > **Import**.
<ol start="9"><li>Paste the URL to your file archive and click <b>Import</b>.
 <div class="alert alert-info">
 <h4 class="info">Note</h4>
 <p>URL Imports have a file size limit of 500MB. If your import fails, download the backup, decompress contents locally, and <a href="/docs/rsync-and-sftp">upload your files directly using rsync or SFTP</a>.</p>
 </div>
</li></ol>

#### HTTP 404 error: Unable to download the archive

Go the to files directory of your existing site and check if the site archive was generated successfully. Visiting the archive link with a browser should download the files automatically. You may need to run the `drush ard` command from [above](#drupal) again if you can't find the site archive.
