<p markdown="1">This doc uses [Terminus](/docs/terminus/) commands. Before we begin, set the variables `$site` and `$env` in your terminal session to match your site name and the correct environment:
<pre>
<code class="bash">export site=yoursitename
export env=dev

## Default Temporary Path
Pantheon configures an appropriate temporary path for [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/blob/4.9.6/wp-config.php#L83-L86){.external} and [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/blob/8.5.3/sites/default/settings.pantheon.php#L146-L154){.external}. Drupal 7 sites can achieve the same configuration by adding the following to `settings.php`:

```php
/**
 * Drupal 7
 * Define appropriate location for tmp directory
 */
if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
  $conf['file_temporary_path'] = $_SERVER['HOME'] .'/tmp';
}
```
## Fix Unsupported Temporary Path
Errors caused by an unsupported temporary path typically surface as permission errors for `.tmp` files and can be replicated on any environment.

  Since the writable path accross all environment in Pantheon for WordPress sites is `/wp-content/uploads` folder, we can correct an unsupported temporary path set by a plugin or theme in `wp-config.php`. Replace `SOME_TMP_SETTING` with the conflicting plugin or theme option:

  ```php
  /**
  * WordPress
  * Fix unsupported temporary path
  * Replace SOME_TMP_SETTING
  */
  if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
    define('SOME_TMP_SETTING', $_SERVER['HOME'] . '/wp-content/uploads/tmp');
  }
  ```
  Verify the setting by using [Terminus](/docs/terminus/) to run `wp config get`:

  ```command
  terminus wp $site.$env -- config get SOME_TMP_SETTING
  ```

  Output of this command should look something like the following Contact Form 7 example:

  ![config get wpcf7 uploads tmp dir default](/source/docs/assets/images/wp-config-get-tmp-default.png)

  Correct an unsupported temporary path set by a module or theme using `$conf` override in `settings.php`. Replace `some_tmp_setting` with the conflicting module or theme setting:

  ```php
  /**

  * Replace some_tmp_setting
  */
  if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
    $conf['some_tmp_setting'] = $_SERVER['HOME'] . '/tmp';
  }
  ```
  Verify the setting by using [Terminus](/docs/terminus/) to run `drush variable-get`:

  ```command
  terminus drush $site.$env -- variable-get some_tmp_setting
  ```

  Output of this command should look something like the following Plupload example:

  ![cget plupload settings temporary_uri filesystem](/source/docs/assets/images/d7-vget-tmp-default.png)

## Multiple Application Containers
Errors caused by this scenario occur on production environments (Test or Live) and typically reference some `.tmp` file as not found and could not be copied. These errors cannot be replicated on development environments (Dev or Multidev) since those environments use a single application container.

Sites on the Performance Medium plan and above have multiple [application containers](/docs/application-containers). To help sites perform at scale, the platform routes requests across available application containers based on their load.

The default temporary path (`$_SERVER['HOME'] . '/tmp'`) is not synchronized across application containers, so operations that expect this path to persist will fail.

### Considerations
It's not common for a plugin, module, or theme to use the temporary path in a way that results in such errors. We suggest reporting the issue to the author and replacing the conflicting plugin, module, or theme whenever possible until a fix is released.

Be aware that temporary files are not cleaned up automatically in the following configuration, which can result in [highly populated directories](/docs/platform-considerations/#highly-populated-directories).

### Persistent Temporary Path Workaround
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p markdown="1">
In general, there's no need for temporary files to persist across application containers. Using a different plugin or module is preferred to taking the performance hit caused by the workaround below.

  Configure a temporary path that uses a private subdirectory of Pantheon's networked filesystem in `wp-config.php`. Replace `SOME_TMP_SETTING` with the conflicting plugin or theme option:

  ```php
  /**
  * WordPress
  * Persistent tmp across app containers
  * Replace SOME_TMP_SETTING
  */
  if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
    define('SOME_TMP_SETTING', 'wp-content/uploads/private/tmp');
  }
  ```
  The `private` and `tmp` directories do not exist by default; you must create the folders via SFTP if you have not done so already. We do not recommend using a public path since core treats the temporary path as non-web-accessible by default.

  Verify the setting by using [Terminus](/docs/terminus/) to run `wp config get`:

  ```command
  terminus wp $site.$env -- config get SOME_TMP_SETTING
  ```

  Output of this command should look something like the following Contact Form 7 example:

  ![config get wpcf7 uploads tmp dir filesystem](/source/docs/assets/images/wp-config-get-tmp-filesystem.png)
