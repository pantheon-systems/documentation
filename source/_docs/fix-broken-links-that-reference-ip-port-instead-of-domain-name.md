When editing content, links can be inserted that don't reflect the site's domain name. For example, an image URL appears as http://192.237.142.203:5555/files/cernettes.gif instead of http://www.example.com/files/cernettes.gif.

The link may work at first, but will eventually break when your application container’s IP address changes due to the nature of Pantheon’s cloud-based infrastructure.

**Solution**:

Set the `$base_url` per environment in settings.php and clear caches.


## Background

Sometimes, the `$base_url`, if not explicitly set, is the URL from which the asset was loaded. If a module cache is populated on a Drush Cron run from the CLI, this can be the app-container IP which is dynamic and will ultimately become a broken link. The current resolution is to set `$base_url` per environment in settings.php and clear caches. There are some notes about this in the [Pathologic documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/257026).

If you look through the Media module issue queue, you’ll see that other users have experienced the same or very similar issues with WYSIWYG-inserted images having their base URLs cached. The IP address is coming from a cached reference to the image’s location as generated by the media filter. Dave Reid (the Media module maintainer) has explained it in [this comment](https://drupal.org/node/1660936#comment-6270618).

The recommended solution is setting the `$base_url` in your settings.php. This prevents the IP:PORT address from being stored in URLs. Check that you're using the latest version of the module(s).

Here is an example of a code snippet to set the `$base_url` per environment:

````
if (isset($_SERVER['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
  switch ($_SERVER['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']) {
    case 'dev':
      $base_url = 'http://dev-example.pantheonsite.io'; // NO trailing slash!
      break;
    case 'test':
      $base_url = 'http://test-example.pantheonsite.io'; // NO trailing slash!
      break;
    case 'live':
      $base_url = 'http://www.example.tld'; // NO trailing slash!
      break;
    }
}
````
Try customizing that snippet for your purposes and putting in your settings.php, and then clearing caches. All cached IP:PORT references will be wiped out, and repopulated with the correct base URL in the future.
