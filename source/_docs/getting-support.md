## Chat Support
Start a chat with our Support Team to request assistance on issues within our [scope of support](#scope-of-support). This support feature is available to all users and sites across all plans, including Sandbox.

1. From your Site or User Dashboard, click **Support**.
2. Click **Launch Chat**, then click **New Conversation**.
3. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
 - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
 - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
 - When the issue began.
 - Error messages received, if applicable.
 - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.

<p markdown="1">Some in-browser ad or tracking blockers can interfere with the **Launch Chat** button. If you don't see it, try whitelisting `pantheon.io` or disabling the browser extension. Intercom has posted more details on [why this happens](https://docs.intercom.com/faqs-and-troubleshooting/your-users-and-leads-data-in-intercom/why-am-i-missing-users-that-are-showing-up-on-my-own-system) on their site.</p>

## Ticket Support
The ticket support feature is available to certain plans and account types. For details, refer to the [support feature table above](#support-features-and-response-times).

1. Create a support ticket from within the site's Dashboard by clicking **Support** > **Open Ticket**. This will automatically include the site and user information.
2. Choose the **ticket type**.
3. Enter a subject (summary of your issue).
4. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
  - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
  - When the issue began.
  - Error messages received, if applicable.
  - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.
5. Click **Open Ticket**

## Scope of Support

We love helping developers succeed! We also have limits to the support we can provide. The key to a great relationship is clear expectations of our support scope. For details on ways to contact our Support team and review support features, visit [Getting Support](/docs/getting-support).

- We don't touch client code.
Your site code belongs to you. Pantheon provides updates to the upstream for the site, which only affect core files and Pantheon-specific additions. It is your responsibility not to overwrite the upstream. If you do, updates on the Dashboard will cause conflicts that you must [resolve manually](/docs/upstream-updates#apply-upstream-updates-manually-from-the-command-line-and-resolve-merge-conflicts) with Git.

- Outdated versions of core are not supported on the platform. This includes importing a site, then manually downgrading to an older version of core. Sites utilizing a [Custom Upstream must be updated](/docs/maintain-custom-upstream/) by the upstream maintainer each time the project releases a new version.

- We don’t maintain the integrity of the site. We provide the platform on which any code can be deployed. We fully stand behind the platform and support that, but we aren't responsible for the code and configuration that gets deployed or any files uploaded to the site. We strongly encourage all developers and site owners to follow best security practices and keep core code and contributed modules and plugins up-to-date, especially with security-related releases.

- We love adding features, but platform changes take time and consideration, and unfortunately feature requests are often declined if there is potential performance or user experience degradation.

- Pantheon provides a great backend, but cannot provide code-level debugging, Git training, or site architecture recommendations. New Relic and debugging can get you pretty far.  We have a [comprehensive list of docs](https://pantheon.io/docs/tags/debug/) to get you underway.

- If your site is slow or modules aren't working, please see our [performance articles](/docs/code/#performance). Issues with the platform are posted on our [status page](http://status.pantheon.io). If there are no platform events, the solution is probably within the site's code.

- Pantheon can only assist if we can replicate the problem. Intermittent issues and server errors are rarely random, rather, they are issues with a yet undefined trigger. Please try to replicate and debug [site errors](/docs/errors-and-server-responses/) in your Development environment. If you [contact support](/docs/getting-support), include your findings and attach screenshots whenever possible.

- We recommend development on the platform, rather than on a local environment. Unexpected behavior, not apparent on local instances such as MAMP or shared hosting, can be due to different versions of PHP, different levels of error reporting, Apache vs NGINX, or server configuration. Pantheon is not responsible for resolving such issues.

- Pantheon Support can quickly determine if an issue is platform related. We take full responsibility for our services and performance, but if something is affecting your site only, or a single environment only, we will most likely refer you to our debugging tutorials.

- If we see your site is a volcano of errors or overloading resources, we will contact you and ask you to take immediate action. If unresponsive, we may need to put the site into maintenance mode.

If you need a professional to provide development support for your site, use Pantheon's [Agency Finder](https://pantheon.io/agencies/agency-finder) to search for qualified partners you can trust.

## Feature Requests

We value your feedback! If you feel there's something we can do to improve our platform, like adding a new [external Library](/docs/external-libraries), or a dashboard feature, contact support and let us know. Include a description of your use case, and a link to the website for any library or other third-party included in your request.

All feature requests will evaluated by Pantheon's Operations Team on a case-by-case basis.


### How long does the process take?
This depends on the feature requested, the impact it could possibly have on a system, roadmap and organizational goals. During the process we will let you know if the request is denied or approved, along with an expected timeline.

It is very important to note, these requests are not guaranteed and it is possible the feature requests may be denied. As a result we recommend you should set aside enough time for alternative solutions.


## FAQs
#### Is there a support number we can call? If so, is this service available for every plan?

For **Elite plans** and customers with **Priority Enterprise Support** only, 24/7 emergency support is available post-launch, and we provide an emergency support number to page on duty engineers. For more details, see the [Elite Plan Support Overview](https://pantheon.io/resources/pantheon-support-datasheet) or learn more about [Priority Enterprise Support](https://pantheon.io/priority-enterprise-support).

####If we open a ticket, do you provide 24/7 support for outages, or are there time restrictions?
You can file a downtime ticket for outages on our Support page, and we provide 24/7 on-call support for all platform issues affecting paying sites.

####Is 24/7 phone support available for Business plans?
No, but we do provide two monthly scheduled calls with a Senior Customer Success Engineer for Business plans. Elite plans and Priority Enterprise Support customers have access to an emergency line to page the on-call staff 24/7 regarding downtime issues.

#### What is Priority Enterprise Support?
For organizations that want the highest level of support for their whole team, [Priority Enterprise Support](https://pantheon.io/priority-enterprise-support) provides the assurance of SLA-backed 24/7/365 emergency support, expedited responses to standard tickets, and expert onboarding and training. To learn more, see [Using Priority Enterprise Support](/docs/priority-enterprise-support) or [contact Sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us) for more information.

####What if I can't login to the Pantheon Dashboard?
If you are unable to login, try [resetting your password](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/reset-password).

#### How can I review my chat threads?
Access support history for chats in the User or Site Dashboards by selecting **Support** > **Launch Chat**.

#### Can I start a chat session via email?
No. Initiate chats via the Pantheon User or Site Dashboards.


#### Can I respond to an existing chat message via email?
