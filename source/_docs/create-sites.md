The Pantheon Dashboard provides a quick "click to install" method of creating new sites. In less than five minutes, you'll have a new site up and running on the platform.

## Create a Site

1.  From your User Dashboard, click **Create New Site**.
2.  Name your site.

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    <h4 class="info">Note</h4>
    <p>The site name will be prefixed to all <a href="/docs/domains/#platform-domains">Platform URLs</a>, which are automatically configured as subdomains of <code>pantheonsite.io</code>.
    </p></div>
3.  If applicable, affiliate the site with an [organization](/docs/organization-dashboard/#new-sites).
4.  Click **Create Site**.
5.  Select your [start state](/docs/start-state). Install WordPress, Drupal 8, or Drupal 7 with one click. You can also select from any of the public or [Custom Upstreams](/docs/custom-upstream) available on the platform.
6.  Click **Visit your Pantheon Dashboard**.
7.  Click **Visit Development Site** and complete the installation process for the selected framework.

## Sandbox Sites

Sandbox sites are useful for trying out the Pantheon platform, creating sandboxes for development, or for starting a new client project. A Sandbox has the equivalent resources of a Performance Small site. We allocate two Sandbox sites for all user accounts. If you've reached your limit of Sandbox sites, delete an unused site, take a site live or join an organization. If you're building sites for third parties, join the [Pantheon Partner Program](http://pantheon.io/agencies/partner-program){.external} for more sandbox sites, Multidev environments, and other features. If you're at an educational institution, sign up for [Pantheon for EDU](https://pantheon.io/pantheon-top-edu){.external}.

## Your Pantheon Account
Your account is your own individual account, and every account can manage multiple projects or sites at a time. Pantheon doesn't recommend sharing your account with other people. If you're collaborating on a project or handing over ownership to a client, use our [team management](/docs/team-management) and [ownership transfer](/docs/site-owner-faq/#billing-tasks) tools.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Can I rename my Pantheon site after creation?
No. Site names and Platform URLs are permanent and cannot be changed. As a workaround, you can export your existing site and import it to a new site with the correct name. See <a href="/docs/migrate/#how-do-i-clone-an-existing-pantheon-site" data-proofer-ignore>Migrate Sites to Pantheon FAQs</a>.

### What if my site name is already taken?

Site names must be unique across all Pantheon sites, including [frozen](/docs/platform-considerations/#inactive-site-freezing) sites. Choose another site name, and remember that the name you choose in the Pantheon Dashboard is only visible to the public in your [platform domain](/docs/domains/#platform-domains).
