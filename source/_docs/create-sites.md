The Pantheon Dashboard provides a quick "click to install" method of creating new sites. In less than five minutes, you'll have a new site up and running on the platform.

## Create a Site

1. From your User Dashboard, click **Create New Site**.
2. Name your site.Â 
  <div class="alert alert-info">
  <h4 class="info">Note</h4>
  <p>The site name will be prefixed to all <a href="/docs/platform-domains">Platform URLs</a>, which are automatically configured as subdomains of <code>pantheonsite.io</code>.
  </p></div>
3. If applicable, affiliate the site with an [organization](/docs/organization-dashboard/#new-sites).
4. Click **Create Site**.
5. Select your [start state](/docs/start-state). Install WordPress, Drupal 8, or Drupal 7 with one click. You can also select from any of the public or [private distributions](/docs/custom-upstream) available on the platform.
6. Click **Visit your Pantheon Dashboard**.
7. Click **Visit Development Site** and complete the installation process for the selected framework.

## Free Sites

Free sites are useful for trying out the Pantheon platform, creating sandboxes for development, or for starting a new client project. We allocate two free sandbox sites for all user accounts. If you have reached your limit of Sandbox sites, delete an unused site or take a site live. If you're building sites for third parties, sign up for [Pantheon for Agencies](https://pantheon.io/agencies/pantheon-for-agencies). If you're at an educational institution, sign up for [Pantheon for EDU](https://pantheon.io/pantheon-top-edu).

## Your Pantheon Account
Your account is your own individual account, and every account can manage multiple projects or sites at a time. Pantheon doesn't recommend sharing your account with other people. If you're collaborating on a project or handing over ownership to a client, use our [team management](/docs/team-management) and [ownership transfer](/docs/site-owner-faq/#billing-tasks) tools. 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Can I rename my Pantheon site after creation?

This is currently not possible on the platform. Site names and Platform URLs are permanent and cannot be changed. As as a workaround, you can export your existing site and import it to a new site with the correct name. See [Cloning an Existing Pantheon Site](https://pantheon.io/docs/clone-site/).
