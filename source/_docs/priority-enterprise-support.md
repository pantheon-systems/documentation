For organizations that want the highest level of support for their whole team, Priority Enterprise Support provides the assurance of SLA-backed 24/7/365 emergency support for downtime and business critical issues, expedited responses to standard support tickets, and expert onboarding and training.

Priority Enterprise Support is great for:

- **Enterprise Organizations** who want the best support for developers across their organization
- **Resellers** who want Pantheon on-call so they can provide even better service to their clients
- **EDU+ Organizations** with a central IT team who want to provide Pantheon as a service across their institution

If you're interested in adding the Priority Enterprise Support feature, contact [Sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us).

## Pantheon On-Call Support Feature
Pantheon On-Call is our highest level of support. It is our commitment to responding rapidly to any team emergency, 24/7/365. Pantheon On-Call should be used for critical business issues and emergencies like site downtime, problems with a launch, or workflow issues that are blocking your team. Once triggered, the issue enters our highest tier of support, paging our team if necessary, to receive an immediate response and escalated attention.

Pantheon On-Call is included in your site’s Elite plan or as part of your organization’s Priority Enterprise Support package.

## Support Ticket Options
On the Support page, you'll have two options for submitting tickets: "Open support ticket" and "On-Call Support".

### Submit a Regular Support Ticket
You should submit this type of ticket for issues or questions that do not involve site downtime. Your ticket will be prioritized higher in the queue and Support will typically respond within two hours during regular business hours.

1. From anywhere in your Organization Dashboard, click **Support**.
2. Click **Open support ticket**.
3. Choose the **site** and **ticket type**.
4. Enter a subject (summary of your issue).
5. Provide important details in your request:
 - Give the steps to reproduce the issue, including URLs or paths to files.
 - The environment being affected (Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
 - When the issue began.

### Submit a Pantheon On-Call Ticket
You should only open an emergency ticket when your site is down or there is a business critical issue (e.g. development team blockers and urgent deadline-driven questions) that you need immediate help with. On-call support is available 24/7/365 and we guarantee escalation in 60 minutes.
