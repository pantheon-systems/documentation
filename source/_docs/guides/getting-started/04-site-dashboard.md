In this lesson, you’ll explore the Site Dashboard and learn about the Dev, Test, Live workflow.

1. Navigate to the **Site Dashboard**.

  Every Pantheon site comes with 3 separate environments—Dev, Test, Live—which are represented by tabs on your dashboard.

    <div class="alert alert-info">
    <h4 class="info">Note</h4>
    <p>Agencies have access to additional Dev environments under the Multidev tab.
    </p></div>

  By default, you’ll find yourself on the **Dev** tab. This is your development environment. It provides access to a stand-alone copy of your site, with its own codebase, database, and files.

  Within the safety of this isolated environment, you can edit code and make updates to your site. In fact, all development on your Pantheon sites starts here.

2. Navigate to the **Test** tab. This environment is for reviewing the changes made in your Dev environment with the most recent content from your live site.

To use the Test environment for this purpose, you first push new code “up” from your Dev environment and clone recent content “down” from your Live environment.

3. Navigate to the **Live** tab. This environment is for your live site, where content creators actively post and upload media files.

After passing review, you push your new code “up” from the Test environment to this Live environment.

4. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the other tabs and links on the Site Dashboard, or click below for a guided tour:

    <div class="panel panel-video" id="accordion">
      <div class="panel-heading panel-video-heading">
        <a class="accordion-toggle panel-video-title collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-proofer-ignore data-target="#user-dashboard-tour"><h3 class="panel-title panel-video-title" style="cursor:pointer;">Tour: Site Dashboard</h3></a>
      </div>
