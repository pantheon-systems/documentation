In this lesson, we’re going to create and configure a new WordPress or Drupal site.

1. Navigate to the **Sites** tab of your User Dashboard.

2. Select **+ Create New Site**. You’ll be asked to name this site and, if you’re part of an agency, associate this site with your organization.

3. Select **Continue** and explore the available site types and pre-packaged distributions.

<p>Organizations can add their own sites to this list! We call these Private Upstreams, and they function as common start states. Organizations use them to spin up multiple sites with the same codebase, modules, plugins, themes, etc., and to make quick updates to these sites en masse.

4. For the purpose of this Guide, deploy WordPress or Drupal 8 by clicking the appropriate button. This takes a few moments. So while you wait, learn what’s happening behind the scenes:

5. Complete? Click **Visit your Pantheon Site Dashboard**.
