In this lesson, we’re going to to create our Test site and our Live site, which we just learned about in the previous lesson.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
  <p>If you haven’t completed the installation of your Dev site, return to <a href=
  "/getting-started/create-new-site">Create New Site</a>, and do this now, before proceeding.</p>
</div>

1. Navigate to your Site Dashboard and click the **Test** tab. Here you’ll have access to your Test environment, but it hasn’t been created yet. Do this now by clicking **Create Test Environment**.

  This takes a few moments. While you wait, let’s learn about what’s happening behind the scenes:

  <div class="panel panel-video" id="accordion">
    <div class="panel-heading panel-video-heading">
      <a class="accordion-toggle panel-video-title collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-proofer-ignore data-target="#create-test-environment"><h3 class="panel-title panel-video-title" style="cursor:pointer;">Understand: Create Test Environment</h3></a>
    </div>
  </div>

2. Now click **Visit Test Site**. This will open your Test site in a new browser tab with the URL    *test-YOURSITE.pantheonsite.io*.

3. Navigate back to your Site Dashboard, and click the **Live** tab. Here again you need to create the environment. Do this now by clicking **Create Live Environment**.

4. This time, while we wait, let’s navigate to **Workflows** . In the dropdown you’ll find your active workflow as well as those workflows we’ve completed to this point.
