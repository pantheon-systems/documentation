In this lesson, we’re going to to create our Test site and our Live site, which we just learned about in the previous lesson.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
  <p>If you haven’t completed the installation of your Dev site, return to <a href=
  "/docs/guides/getting-started/create-new-site">Create New Site</a>, and do this now, before proceeding.</p>
</div>

1. Navigate to your Site Dashboard and click the **Test** tab. Here you’ll have access to your Test environment, but it hasn’t been created yet. Do this now by clicking **Create Test Environment**.

  This takes a few moments. 
  
2. Now click **Visit Test Site**. This will open your Test site in a new browser tab with the URL *test-YOURSITE.pantheonsite.io*.

3. Navigate back to your Site Dashboard, and click the **Live** tab. Here again you need to create the environment. Do this now by clicking **Create Live Environment**.

4. This time, while we wait, let’s navigate to **Workflows** . In the dropdown you’ll find your active workflow as well as those workflows we’ve completed to this point.
