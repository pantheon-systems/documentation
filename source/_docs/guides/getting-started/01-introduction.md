Welcome! This guide is designed to get you started on Pantheon. It should take less than 1 hour to complete.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Configure and use our best-practice development workflow
- Perform on-server development

All you need to get started is an account. If you don't have one, follow the link below to create a free account.
