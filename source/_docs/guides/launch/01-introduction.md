Welcome! This guide will help you take a site live on Pantheon. This is an irrelevant change, to use for a demonstration.

**In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:**

* Upgrade a site to a paid plan
* Add a custom domain
* Enable free, automated HTTPS
* Redirect traffic to a single domain (e.g., `www.example.com` or `example.com`)

To get started, you need to [create your Live environment](/docs/guides/getting-started/create-test-live/) and have a registered domain name where you can control DNS settings.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
Pantheon is not a domain registrar, and we do not offer DNS management as a service. To connect a custom domain to Pantheon, you need to register one with a third-party provider.
