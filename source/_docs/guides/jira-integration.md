Atlassian's suite of developer tools is well known.

In this guide, we will create and configure the Jira to a site on Pantheon. 

After deploy, automation updates jira tickets


SAML??

secrets.json got to files/private

## What Youâ€™ll Need

- A Jira Instance.

- A Drupal or Wordpress site on Pantheon.

## Create a Jira Service Account

1. For security and isolation, from the Jira user administration dashboard, create a user with standard permissions.

![Service account creation](/source/docs/assets/images/integrations/jira/service_account.png)

## Create a private folder for this accounts credentials.

1. Use the following php command to create a JSON file, useing your Jira url and the service account's Jira username and password.
```
  $> php -r "print json_encode(['jira_url'=>'https://myjira.atlassian.net','jira_user'=>'serviceaccount','jira_pass'=>'secret']);" > secrets.json
```
 
2. FTP this file to a directory you will create in your Pantheon /files directory called secrets. This exact naming convention ensures its contents are not web-accesible. Repeat this process for any existing environments. Each environment should have a file similar to this:

![Secrets folder](/source/docs/assets/images/integrations/jira/secrets.png)

This can also be done quickly with [Terminus](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus) if it is installed locally.

```
$> `terminus site connection-info --env=dev --site=your-site --field=sftp_command`
      Connected to appserver.dev.000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000.drush.in.
  sftp> cd files
  sftp> mkdir private
  sftp> cd private
  sftp> put secrets.json
 ```

## Configure Quicksilver Integration
 
1. Clone Pantheon's [Quicksilver Example Repo](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples)to your local computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples.git quicksilver-examples

```

2. Locate your local copy of your Pantheon site's repository, or clone it if you haven't already.

```
git clone git clone ssh://codeserver.dev.000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000@codeserver.dev.000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000.drush.in:2222/~/repository.git astro-mktg
```

3. From the root directory of your local copy (at the same level as index.php), create a directory named "private" and copy jira_integration.php script to it.

```
$ mkdir private
$ cd private
$ cp /path/to/your/quicksilver-examples/jira_integration/jira_integration.php .
$ ls
jira_integration.php
```

    Now we will log in and set up monitoring. Click the **SET UP YOUR MONITORING** button to go directly to the Pingdom dashboard.

2. Add the example jira_integration.php script to the private directory of your code repository.

3. Add a Quicksilver operation to your pantheon.yml to fire the script after a deploy.
   
```
#always include the api version
api_version: 1

workflows:
  sync_code:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Jira Integration
        script: private/jira_integration.php
```
4. Test

Now if you push code with a commit message containing a Jira issue ID, the jira_integration.php script with parse the commits, searching within the commit message for an alphabetical string and a numeric string, separated by a hyphen ("WEB-123"), and attempt to post it to the relevant ticket. You can also reference multiple commits:

```
git commit -m "WEB-113: This commit also fixes WEB-294 and INF-3"
```

When testing, you can use the **terminus workflows:watch** command with the Pantheon site ID to see the integration in real time:

```
$ git commit -am "WEB-13: adding CSS changes, also closes WEB-6 and WEB-5"
$ terminus workflow:watch 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

When we return to Jira, we can see the commit message in the activity tab of the issue:

![Jira issue](/source/docs/assets/images/integrations/jira/jira_log.png)

If we have the development panel viewable in Jira, we can also see the activity there.




## Conclusion
Pingdom has a few more checks and features we did not cover. Depending on your plan it provides a site status page, multi-tier alerting schedules, and API access for custom integration.

When a site is having issues, Pingdom lets the right people know quickly and provides good data to help find solutions. It's a good practice to use services like Pingdom on all high-value sites.
