<Alert title="Note" type="info">
Are you an agency? Do you build sites for others? If so, check <strong>Are you an agency?</strong> on the <a href="https://pantheon.io/register" target="_blank">signup form <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt"></span></a> to get more free features and really make the most of this guide.
