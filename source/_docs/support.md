## Support Features and Response Times
The majority of Pantheon's support is provided in the context of a particular website or project. Because of that, the type of support available varies according to whether you are paying for a site individually, or using Pantheon as an Agency, EDU, or Enterprise customer.

All users of the platform can receive customer service and support for non-site-related questions via any available medium regardless of account type.

## Real Time Chat Support
Start a chat with our Support Team to ask questions or request assistance on issues within our [scope of support](#scope-of-support). This support feature is available to all users and sites across all plans, including Sandbox.

1. From your Site or User Dashboard, click **Support**.
2. Click **Launch Chat**, then click **New Conversation**.
3. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
 - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
 - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
 - When the issue began.
 - Error messages received, if applicable.
 - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">Some in-browser ad or tracking blockers can interfere with the **Launch Chat** button. If you don't see it, try whitelisting `pantheon.io` or disabling the browser extension. Intercom has posted more details on [why this happens](https://docs.intercom.com/faqs-and-troubleshooting/your-users-and-leads-data-in-intercom/why-am-i-missing-users-that-are-showing-up-on-my-own-system) on their site.</p>
</div>

## Ticket Support
The ticket support feature is available to certain plans and account types. For details, refer to the [support feature table above](#support-features-and-response-times).  Tickets are associated to the site from which the ticket is opened.  Please be sure that if you maintain several sites, that you open the ticket from the correct site's dashboard.

1. Create a support ticket from within the site's Dashboard by clicking **Support** > **Open Ticket**. This will automatically include the site and user information.
2. Choose the **ticket type**.
3. Enter a subject (summary of your issue).
4. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
  - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
  - When the issue began.
  - Error messages received, if applicable.
  - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.
5. Click **Open Ticket**

## Pantheon On-Call
Elite sites and organizations who opt for [Priority Enterprise Support](#priority-enterprise-support) can directly access Pantheon's operations response team, either via their Pantheon dashboard, or by an emergency 800-number. Pantheon on-call has a response time SLA of 30 minutes and immediately escalates to the on-call engineering team. The scope of on-call support is limited to emergencies and business critical issues.

## Priority Enterprise Support
Priority Enterprise Support is a blanket support plan which can be purchased for any organization. It covers all team members and sites, adding a 2-hour SLA for ticket responses and the ability to trigger Pantheon's on-call emergency system described above. [Learn more](https://pantheon.io/priority-enterprise-support).

## Scope of Support

We love helping developers succeed! We also have limits to the support we can provide. The key to a great relationship is clear expectations of our support scope.

### Code
We don't touch client code. Your site code belongs to you. Pantheon provides updates to the upstream for the site, which only affect core files and Pantheon-specific additions. It is your responsibility not to overwrite the upstream. If you do, updates on the Dashboard will cause conflicts that you must [resolve manually](/docs/core-updates#apply-upstream-updates-manually-from-the-command-line-to-resolve-merge-conflicts) with Git.

### Outdated Core
Outdated versions of core are not supported on the platform. This includes importing a site, then manually downgrading to an older version of core. Sites utilizing a [Custom Upstream must be updated](/docs/maintain-custom-upstream/) by the upstream maintainer each time the project releases a new version.

### Custom Upstreams
If you choose to use a custom upstream, please be aware that the scope of support is limited to verification that the externally hosted upstream repository is properly connected to the platform.

We are unable to debug issues with the content or structure of the Custom Upstream. While we encourage you to explore this great way to unify multiple sites, please be aware that the burden of testing and [properly maintaining the Custom Upstream](/docs/maintain-custom-upstream/), and the negative impact if it is not done properly is inherited by your team.

### Public Distributions
If you choose to use a [public distribution](/docs/start-state/#public-distributions) (a.k.a. installation profile or distribution) in lieu of a [Pantheon provided upstream](/docs/start-state/#pantheon-upstreams) (i.e. WordPress, Drupal 8, Drupal 7), please be aware that we cannot provide platform support for it. If the distribution you are using is behind on core releases or any of its included plugins, please contact the maintainer through [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org){.external} or the distribution's GitHub issue queue.

### Security
We donâ€™t maintain the integrity of the site. We provide the platform on which any code can be deployed. We fully stand behind the platform and support that, but we aren't responsible for the code and configuration that gets deployed or any files uploaded to the site. We strongly encourage all developers and site owners to follow best security practices and keep core code and contributed modules and plugins up-to-date, especially with security-related releases.

### Debugging
Pantheon provides a great backend, but cannot provide code-level debugging, Git training, or site architecture recommendations. New Relic and debugging can get you pretty far.  We have a [comprehensive list of docs](/docs/troubleshoot/) to get you underway.

### Performance
If your site is slow or modules aren't working, please see our [performance articles](/docs/code/#performance). Issues with the platform are posted on our [status page](https://status.pantheon.io). If there are no platform events, the solution is probably within the site's code.

### Intermittent Issues
Pantheon can only assist if we can replicate the problem. Intermittent issues and server errors are rarely random, rather, they are issues with a yet undefined trigger. Please try to replicate and debug [site errors](/docs/errors-and-server-responses/) in your Development environment. If you [contact support](/docs/support), include your findings and attach screenshots whenever possible.

### Local Development
We recommend development on the platform, rather than on a local environment. Unexpected behavior, not apparent on local instances such as MAMP or shared hosting, can be due to different versions of PHP, different levels of error reporting, Apache vs NGINX, or server configuration. Pantheon is not responsible for resolving such issues.

### Isolated Issues
Pantheon Support can quickly determine if an issue is platform related. We take full responsibility for our services and performance, but if something is affecting your site only, or a single environment only, we will most likely refer you to our debugging tutorials.

If we see your site is a volcano of errors or overloading resources, we will contact you and ask you to take immediate action. If unresponsive, we may need to put the site into maintenance mode.

### Platform Support

We provide technical support for all user interfaces of the Pantheon product, as well as compatibility with the Drupal and WordPress CMSs. While we cannot guarantee that every Drupal module or WordPress plugin will work, we take responsibility for the availability and proper functionality of the platform. If there's something wrong there, we will fix it.

We are also happy to help developers learn the ins and outs of making their sites work great on Pantheon, and have a large number of tutorials for common development scenarios. We also do our best to answer most questions about development practices or techniques.

### Full Stack Support

Customers with Full Stack support get an extra level of assistance for their dev teams. Pantheon's team can investigate misbehavior, slowness, or error logs to help identify a root cause. This includes everything from database queries to front end performance.

Our team is experienced with using New Relic to diagnose whether an issue is platform or site related, and has access to internal logging and monitoring. Full Stack Support can help troubleshoot networking issues and other problems that can be difficult to resolve from the outside.

This level of support is intended to help developers succeed on Pantheon, not to provide development services. If you need a professional to provide development services for your site, start by [getting a personalized quote](https://pantheon.io/agencies/agency-match){.external} from Pantheonâ€™s network of trusted partners.

## Feature Requests

We value your feedback! If you feel there's something we can do to improve our platform, like adding a new [external Library](/docs/external-libraries), or a dashboard feature, contact support and let us know. Include a description of your use case, and a link to the website for any library or other third-party included in your request.

All feature requests will evaluated by Pantheon's product and engineering teams on a case-by-case basis. We love adding new capabilities, but platform changes take time and consideration, and unfortunately feature requests are often declined if there is potential performance or user experience degradation.

### How long does the process take?
This depends on the feature requested, the impact it could possibly have on a system, roadmap and organizational goals. During the process we will let you know if the request is denied or approved.

It is very important to note, these requests are not guaranteed and it is possible the feature requests may be denied. As a result we recommendÂ you should set aside enough time for alternative solutions.

## Help Us Help You

Keep the following tips in mind when opening a new support ticket or chat:

 - **One ticket per issue**: Opening multiple tickets on the same issue will only impeded our ability to provide timely support. When opening a chat conversation to follow up on a discussion from a ticket, please let us know about the ticket so we can read up on what's already been discussed and attempted.

 - **Replication Steps**: One of the first steps in troubleshooting is almost always to recreate the problem. Please provide us with the exact steps to replicate the issue. If we can't see it, we can't debug it.

 - **Specifics**: Ambiguity is the kryptonite of good support. When discussing an issue, give us timestamps, error messages (in full), screenshots, URLs, and any other specific information that can help to identify problems.

 - **Custom Access**: If your site uses nonstandard admin URLs, custom logins, etc, please let us know.

 - **Clarification**: We're all only human. We always try our best to understand the situation, but we may not always get it right the first time. At the same time, our explanations or solutions might not always make sense to you. Don't be afraid to correct us, or to ask for clarification if we don't seem to understand the issue.
