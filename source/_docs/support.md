## Support Features and Response Times
The majority of Pantheon's support is provided in the context of a particular website or project. Because of that, the type of support available varies according to whether you are paying for a site individually, or using Pantheon as an Agency, EDU, EDU+, or Enterprise customer.

Intercom has posted more details on [why this happens](https://docs.intercom.com/faqs-and-troubleshooting/your-users-and-leads-data-in-intercom/why-am-i-missing-users-that-are-showing-up-on-my-own-system) on their site.</p>
</div>

## Ticket Support
The ticket support feature is available to certain plans and account types. For details, refer to the [support feature table above](#support-features-and-response-times).  Tickets are associated to the site from which the ticket is opened.  Please be sure that if you maintain several sites, that you open the ticket from the correct site's dashboard.

1. Create a support ticket from within the site's Dashboard by clicking **Support** > **Open Ticket**. This will automatically include the site and user information.
2. Choose the **ticket type**.
3. Enter a subject (summary of your issue).
4. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
  - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
  - When the issue began.
  - Error messages received, if applicable.
  - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.
5. Click **Open Ticket**

## Pantheon On-Call
Elite sites and organizations who opt for [Priority Enterprise Support](#priority-enterprise-support) can directly access Pantheon's operations response team, either via their Pantheon dashboard, or by an emergency 800-number. Pantheon on-call immediately escalates to the on-call engineering team. The scope of on-call support is limited to emergencies and business critical issues.

## Priority Enterprise Support
Priority Enterprise Support is a blanket support plan which can be purchased for any organization. It covers all team members and sites, adding the ability to trigger Pantheon's on-call emergency system described above. [Learn more](https://pantheon.io/priority-enterprise-support).

## Scope of Support

We love helping developers succeed! Our support plans range from basic platform support to more comprehensive SLA-backed support. While we have limits to the support we can provide, our [Professional Services](https://pantheon.io/docs/professional-services/) team is able to assist in areas that fall outside of support scope. [Contact Sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us){.external} if your requirements fall outside the scope outlined below.

### Code
Your site code belongs to you. If your plan includes full stack support, we can offer advice on best practices with regard to your codebase and are happy to recommend one of our agency partners or refer you to our professional services team to provide development assistance, but our support team does not change the code of our customers. Pantheon provides updates to the upstream for the site, which only affect core files and Pantheon-specific additions. It is your responsibility to ensure the upstream is not overwritten. If it is, updates initiated from the Dashboard will cause conflicts that you must [resolve manually](/docs/core-updates#apply-upstream-updates-manually-from-the-command-line-to-resolve-merge-conflicts) using Git.

### Outdated Core
Outdated versions of core are not supported on the platform. This includes importing a site, then manually downgrading to an older version of core. Sites utilizing a [Custom Upstream must be updated](/docs/maintain-custom-upstream/) by the upstream maintainer each time the project releases a new version.

### Custom Upstreams
If you choose to use a custom upstream, please be aware that the scope of support is limited to verification that the externally hosted upstream repository is properly connected to the platform.

We are unable to debug issues with the content or structure of the Custom Upstream. While we encourage you to explore this great way to unify multiple sites, please be aware that the responsibility of testing, [properly maintaining the Custom Upstream](/docs/maintain-custom-upstream/), and fixing any issues related to the upstream falls outside of the scope of support.

### Public Distributions
If you choose to use a [public distribution](/docs/start-state/#public-distributions) (a.k.a. installation profile or distribution) in lieu of a [Pantheon provided upstream](/docs/start-state/#pantheon-upstreams) (i.e. WordPress, Drupal 8, Drupal 7), please be aware that it falls outside our scope of support. If the distribution you are using is behind on core releases or any of its included plugins, please contact the maintainer through [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org){.external} or the distribution's GitHub issue queue.

### Security
We don’t maintain the integrity of your site. We provide the platform on which any code can be deployed. We fully stand behind the platform and support that, but we aren't responsible for the code and configuration that gets deployed or any files uploaded to the site. We strongly encourage all developers and site owners to follow best security practices and keep core code and contributed modules and plugins up-to-date, especially with security-related releases.

### Debugging
Code-level debugging, Git training, and site architecture recommendations fall outside of our support scope. New Relic and logs can help you get to the bottom of most issues. We have a [comprehensive list of docs](/docs/troubleshoot/) to get you underway. We can recommend an agency partner for you to work with if you need additional assitance, and customers with Gold, Platinum and Diamond support plans may also access our professional services.

### Performance
If your site is slow or modules aren't working, please see our [performance articles](/docs/code/#performance). Issues with the platform are posted on our [status page](https://status.pantheon.io). If there are no platform events, the solution is probably within the site's code.

### Intermittent Issues
Pantheon can only assist if we can replicate the problem. Intermittent issues and server errors are rarely random, rather, they are issues with a yet undefined trigger. Please try to replicate and debug [site errors](/docs/errors-and-server-responses/) in your Development environment. If you [contact support](/docs/support), include your findings and attach screenshots whenever possible.

### Local Development
We recommend development on the platform, rather than on a local environment. Unexpected behavior, not apparent on local instances such as MAMP or shared hosting, can be due to different versions of PHP, different levels of error reporting, Apache vs NGINX, or server configuration. Pantheon is not responsible for resolving such issues.

### Isolated Issues
Pantheon Support can quickly determine if an issue is platform related. We take full responsibility for our services and performance, but if something is affecting your site only, or a single environment only, we will most likely refer you to our debugging tutorials or offer to connect you with an agency partner to help you with the resolution.

If we see your site is a volcano of errors or otherwise overloading resources, we will contact you and ask you to take immediate action. If unresponsive, we may need to put the site into maintenance mode.

### Platform Support

We provide technical support for all user interfaces of the Pantheon product, as well as compatibility with the Drupal and WordPress CMSs. While we cannot guarantee that every Drupal module or WordPress plugin will work, we take responsibility for the availability and proper functionality of the platform. If there's something wrong there, we will fix it.

We are also happy to help developers learn the ins and outs of making their sites work great on Pantheon, and have a large number of tutorials for common development scenarios. We also do our best to answer most questions about development practices or techniques.

### Full Stack Support

Customers with Full Stack support get an extra level of assistance for their dev teams. Pantheon's team can investigate misbehavior, slowness, or error logs to help identify a root cause. This includes everything from database queries to front end performance.

Our team is experienced with using New Relic to diagnose whether an issue is platform or site related, and has access to internal logging and monitoring. Full Stack Support can help troubleshoot networking issues and other problems that can be difficult to resolve from the outside.

This level of support is intended to help developers succeed on Pantheon, not to provide development services. If you need a professional to provide development services for your site, start by [getting a personalized quote](https://pantheon.io/agencies/agency-match){.external} from Pantheon’s network of trusted partners.

## Help Us Help You

Keep the following tips in mind when opening a new support ticket or chat:

 - **One ticket per issue**: Opening multiple tickets on the same issue will only impeded our ability to provide timely support. When opening a chat conversation to follow up on a discussion from a ticket, please let us know about the ticket so we can read up on what's already been discussed and attempted.

 - **Replication Steps**: One of the first steps in troubleshooting is almost always to recreate the problem. Please provide us with the exact steps to replicate the issue. If we can't see it, we can't debug it.

 - **Specifics**: Ambiguity is the kryptonite of good support. When discussing an issue, give us timestamps, error messages (in full), screenshots, URLs, and any other specific information that can help to identify problems.

 - **Custom Access**: If your site uses nonstandard admin URLs, custom logins, etc, please let us know.

 - **Clarification**: We're all only human. We always try our best to understand the situation, but we may not always get it right the first time. At the same time, our explanations or solutions might not always make sense to you. Don't be afraid to correct us, or to ask for clarification if we don't seem to understand the issue.
