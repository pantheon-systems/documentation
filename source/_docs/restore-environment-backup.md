Each site environment's backups are located on the Backups tab for that environment in the Pantheon Dashboard.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p>We do not recommend directly restoring a Live environment from a backup; instead, restore to Dev or Test, then  pull the code change and clone the content to Live. This will minimize user-facing downtime.</p></div>

If you need to restore your site to before the latest deployment, we recommend [undoing your last commit or deploy](/docs/undo-commits) **before** attempting a site restore.

If you need to restore your database or file uploads, we recommend using the [Dashboard Import tool](/docs/restore-environment-backup/#restore-database-and-files), using the URL from the appropriate backup. If your backup files are larger than 500MB, you will need to need to save them locally and [manually import the database](/docs/migrate-manual/#add-your-database) or [sftp/rsync your file uploads](/docs/rsync-and-sftp)

## Before you Begin the Restore Process
It is important that you and your team know that this is a **destructive** process that will **wipe** your database and files, and restore them from the backup. It will also restore the codebase to the state the environment was in when backed up.

When a restore starts, it is placed in a queue and executed. Depending on the size of the site, this operation may take some time; be patient and do not attempt to restart the restore unless you are confident that it completed. During the process of the restore, files may show as missing and the site may show as unavailable. When in doubt, [contact support](/docs/support).

## Restore an Environment From Its Own Backup

Restore a manual or automatic backup (Code, Database, and Files) by clicking the **Restore** button to the right of a backup. This is the recommended and easiest method.

<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">For development environments (e.g., Dev and Multidevs), the **Restore** button is only available when **Development Mode** is set to Git mode. This does not apply to production environments (e.g., Test and Live). For details, see [The Site Dashboard](/docs/sites/#code).</p>

## Restore an Environment From Another Environment's Backup
From within the source environment, find the backup you want to restore and click the download link for Database and Files:

![Temporary backup link](/source/docs/assets/images/dashboard/direct-download-archive.png)

This provides a temporary private link directly from Google Cloud Storage, the external backup host. These links will expire after a few minutes; if the link is no longer working, return to the Dashboard and get a new link. If you want to directly download the backup part (required for code), click **Direct Download**. Otherwise, copy the provided URL.

If you want to download a backup using wget, put the providedÂ temporary link in double quotes:

    wget "https://storage.googleapis.com/gcs-pantheon-backups/..."

### Restore Database and Files
To restore Database and Files, navigate to the target environment and click the **Workflow** tab. Choose **File** and upload the backups for Database and Files if you downloaded the archives directly, otherwise provide the temporary URL for each backup. Click **Import** for each backup part to restore.

If you have an existing database or file archive that you want to import from an external source, you can also upload the content here.

### Restore Code
Code archives contain the full remote Git repository and reflect the state of code for the given environment. Backups created on the Test and Live environments automatically checkout the [`git tag`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) associated with the most recent deployment. However, if you would like to rewind an environment's codebase to a previous state we recommend using `git revert` or `git reset` instead of a code archive.

#### Revert Commits and Preserve History
This method is recommended for distributed teams working collaboratively. To undo commits while preserving the site's Git history:

1. Identify the commit you want to undo using the commit history provided in the Site Dashboard or by reviewing `git log` locally.
2. Copy the commit ID:

 ![commit ID](/source/docs/assets/images/dashboard/commit-id.png)

3. Replace <ID> with the commit ID and run: `git revert <ID> --no-edit`
4. Push the reverted codebase to Pantheon: `git push origin master`
5. Deploy the change from Dev up to Test and Live.

For more information, see [git-revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert).

#### Reset Commits and Overwrite History
This is a destructive process. If you're not comfortable with this technique, use `git revert` instead. To reset the codebase and overwrite history:

1. Identify the last commit you want included using the commit history provided within the Site Dashboard or by reviewing `git log` locally.
2. Copy the commit ID:

 ![commit ID](/source/docs/assets/images/dashboard/commit-id.png)

3. Replace <ID> with the commit ID you want to reset and run: `git reset <ID> --hard`
4. Push the reset codebase to Pantheon: `git push origin master --force`
 The `--force` option should be used sparingly, especially in distributed team environments. For more information, see [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push).
5. Deploy the change from Dev up to Test and Live.

For more information, see [git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset).
