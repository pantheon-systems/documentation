## Load Testing
Load and performance tests are critical steps in ensuring a successful launch. There is no better way to expose and identify potential performance bottlenecks before youâ€™ve launched your site. Load tests provide critical insight for how a site will perform in the wild and under peak traffic spikes. Diamond support plans include load tests in order to ensure that your website launches smoothly and that it is ready to absorb the high traffic that success brings. Expert load tests are also available for Gold and Platinum plans. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/contact-us) for details.
