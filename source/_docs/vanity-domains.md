Pantheon Partners, Strategic Partners, Enterprise accounts, Resellers, and OEM Partners have the ability to provision a custom vanity domain for each environment on every site running on the platform, in addition to the default Platform domain (`pantheonsite.io`).

The Vanity domain can either be a subdomain of your primary site (`sites.mydomain.com`) or a dedicated domain name (`mypantheonprojects.com`).

If a subdomain of your primary site is configured, a newly created site named "supersite" will then have a Dev environment URL of `dev-supersite.sites.mydomain.com`. If a dedicated domain name is used, the site would instead have a Dev environment URL of `dev-supersite.mypantheonprojects.com`.


## Request the Vanity Domain

From your Organization Dashboard, go to Dashboard and [submit a support request](/docs/support) with "Request for custom Vanity domain" as the subject. You must provide the Vanity domain required on the site, like `sites.example.com`.


<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p markdown="1">We recommend using a separate domain from your production site. This prevents any security issues related to domain-specific cookies. Even the same domain under a different TLD (`.com`, `.net`, etc) would suffice.
</p>
</div>

## Create a Wildcard CNAME Record

At your DNS provider, create a wildcard CNAME record pointing to our edge. If you go with `sites.example.com`, the record would need to be created as follows:

`*.sites.example.com` **CNAME** `edge.live.getpantheon.com`

## Effects and Considerations

 - Existing sites created before configuring a Vanity domain will continue to use the default Platform domains and will not use the custom Vanity domain.

 - Sites associated with your organization will receive the custom Vanity domain for all environments (including Multidev) created while the organization remains a supporting organization.

 - After adding a custom Vanity domain to your organization, some workflow operations such as restoring an environment from a backup or changing the PHP version, can cause site domain URLs in other environments to unexpectedly change from the Pantheon domain to the custom domain.

 - **Environment URLs are permanent.** If an organization is removed as the supporting organization, any environment created during its association will keep the original URL after removal. Paid sites can add custom domains to any environment, as a workaround for those wishing to use different URLs after launch and disassociation of the site with the organization.

 - **Do not configure DNS for custom domains using Vanity domain values.** Even after configuring a vanity domain, your custom domain CNAME records should *always* point to the platform domain values, as recommended within the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-global"></span> Domains / HTTPS** page. Vanity domains are designed to be viewed by end users, not added into records for other domains.

    </div>


## Security Considerations

If you run sites on subdomains of your primary site (e.g. `sites.awesomeagency.com`), you should be aware of some security considerations:

* The sites on the subdomains may be able to read cookies set on your primary site.
* If a site on the subdomain is reported as a malicious phishing/spam/malware site, it could prevent access to your main marketing site if Google/Norton/etc. block the site.
* HTTPS is not provisioned for vanity domains. Only custom domains will have HTTPS provisioned.


## Robots.txt with Custom Vanity Domains

For SEO and to prevent duplicate content, the robots.txt file attached to the custom Vanity domain will contain the following by default:

```
# https://live-sitename.agencyname.com/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```
To present an alternate robots.txt file from within the source code, a custom domain needs to be <a href="/docs/guides/launch/domains/" data-proofer-ignore>added to the site's Dashboard</a> and the appropriate DNS record created.
