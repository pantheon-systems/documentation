## Exclude Specific Pages from Caching
You can use a variety of mechanisms to determine which responses from your Drupal or WordPress site should be excluded from caching. Ultimately, these mechanisms result in setting HTTP headers that signal cacheability to Varnish and recipients of the response, like a browser.

Some web developers choose to aggregate all of their caching logic in one place, often the `settings.php` file of Drupal or a plugin dedicated to site-specific functionality in WordPress (as shown in the examples below). Alternatively, you can spread out cache-related code so that it is closest to the elements (i.e. sidebars, footers) that cause the cacheability of the response to be limited (as in this Drupal 8 example).

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
  <li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#d8" aria-controls="d8" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal 8</a></li>
  <li role="presentation"><a href="#d7" aria-controls="d7" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Drupal 7</a></li>
  <li role="presentation"><a href="#wp" aria-controls="wp" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">WordPress</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- Tab panes -->
<div class="tab-content">
  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="d8" markdown="1">
  [Drupal 8's system of cacheability metadata](https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/render/arrays/cacheability) is much more advanced than the tools available in Drupal 7 or WordPress. Drupal builds HTML out of render arrays, which are specially formed PHP arrays. If one layer of a render array cannot be cached (if it's cache max age should be zero) that cacheability metadata can be set with:

  ```php
  // $build is a render array.
  $build['#cache']['max-age'] = 0;
  ```

  Drupal 8 will "bubble up" this information so that if any small block on a page requires a cache max age of zero, the entire page will be uncacheable. Currently [Cache Control Override](https://www.drupal.org/project/cache_control_override) module is required for this feature to behave correctly.

  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="d7" markdown="1">
  Here is an example of a global way to determine a Drupal response's cacheability. Use the `$conf` global variable to set `Cache-Control: max-age=0`:

  ```php
  /*
   * Set $regex_path_patterns accordingly.
   *
   * We don't set this variable for you, so you must define it
   * yourself per your specific use case before the following conditional.
   *
   * For example, to exclude pages in the /news/ and /about/ path from cache, set:
   *
   *   $regex_path_patterns = array(
   *     '#^/news/?#',
   *     '#^/about/?#',
   *   );
   */

  $regex_path_patterns = array(
    '#^/news/?#',
    '#^/about/?#',
  );

  // Loop through the patterns.
  foreach ($regex_path_patterns as $regex_path_pattern) {
    if (preg_match($regex_path_pattern, $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
      drupal_page_is_cacheable(FALSE);
      $conf['page_cache_maximum_age'] = 0;

      // No need to continue the loop once there's a match.
      break;
    }
  }
  ```
  </div>
  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="wp" markdown="1">
  Set `Cache-Control: max-age=0` by hooking into [`send_headers`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/send_headers){.external}. This will override `max-age` configured within the [Pantheon Cache](/docs/wordpress-cache-plugin) plugin for all matching requests:

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
  ### Note {.info}
  Place this code in `wp-config.php` to ensure it's executed on all requests. Calls to the API don't invoke a theme's `functions.php` file.
  </div>
  ```php
  /*
   * Set $regex_path_patterns accordingly.
   *
   * We don't set this variable for you, so you must define it
   * yourself per your specific use case before the following conditional.
   *
   * For example, to exclude pages in the /news/ and /about/ path from cache, set:
   *
   *   $regex_path_patterns = array(
   *     '#^/news/?#',
   *     '#^/about/?#',
   *   );
   */

  $regex_path_patterns = array(
    '#^/news/?#',
    '#^/about/?#',
  );

  // Loop through the patterns.
  foreach ($regex_path_patterns as $regex_path_pattern) {
    if (preg_match($regex_path_pattern, $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
      add_action( 'send_headers', 'add_header_nocache', 15 );

      // No need to continue the loop once there's a match.
      break;
    }
  }
  function add_header_nocache() {
        header( 'Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0' );
  }
  ```
  </div>
</div>

As an alternative to using HTTP headers to control downstream caching, you can set a `NO_CACHE` cookie. For details, see [Working with Cookies on Pantheon](/docs/cookies).

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p>Pantheon does not support manually editing and updating the VCL. We use a standard VCL for all sites on the platform. Requests are accepted, but we do not guarantee change requests will be implemented.</p></div>

## Test Pages Excluded from Cache
To test whether or not a page is being served from Pantheon's edge caching layer, examine the headers output (`Age`, `Cache-Control`, `Set-Cookie`) via the following curl command:
<pre><code class="http hljs">$ curl -I dev.mysite.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Pantheon-Styx-Hostname: styx1a
server: nginx/1.0.15
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
x-drupal-cache: MISS
set-cookie: SESSf60876d132c0913e5fc728eec7f71e38=M1Sr0bxLbbgYmbg1EW7N8sGF4anrKP1np25EkYta-ZU; expires=Wed, 19-Dec-2012 22:04:58 GMT; path=/; domain=.dev.mysite.com; HttpOnly
<b>Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0</b>

x-pantheon-endpoint: c18646dd-aa2b-4faa-a4e3-d71ec3a5ce43

X-Varnish: 486741958
<b>Age: 0</b>
Via: 1.1 varnish
Connection: keep-alive
X-Pantheon-Edge-Server: 108.166.58.245
Vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie
</code></pre>

The `Cache-Control` header in this example instructs Pantheon's edge caching layer (Varnish) not to cache the response for this request. If you run the command again, you should continue to see `Age: 0` for excluded pages. For more details, see [Testing Global CDN Caching](/docs/test-global-cdn-caching/).
