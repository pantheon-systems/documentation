The Organization Dashboard is where Organization Administrators and Team Members manage all their sites in a single location. If you are an Administrator or Team Member for your Organization, you can access support requests, add or remove organizational team members, and manage new or existing sites.

## Add Sites to Your Organization

### New Sites

While creating a new site, any user in your [organization](/docs/organizations/) will see an "Organization Affiliation" select field containing any organizations to which he or she belongs. New sites affiliated this way are automatically added to your Organization Dashboard, and the user who creates the site is made the owner.

### Existing Sites

From the Site Dashboard, the Site Owner will want to:

{% include("content/add-supporting-org.html")%}

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4><p markdown="1"> If your Organization is Enterprise, EDU+, or a Reseller, you will need to [contact support](/docs/support/) to transfer sites to your Organization.</p>
</div>


## Manage Site Teams
If you need to add developers as full team members to a site, or outside contractors to individual sites, the Organization Administrator or existing Site Team Member will need to add them to the site team:

1. Check the box next to the site or sites you want to add the user to.
2. Click **Team** and **Add a team member**.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Click **Add team member**.

The user will receive an email notification with a link to the Site Dashboard.

Removing site team members follows the same process.


## Filter Sites

At the Sites tab, the left panel contains groups of filters for limiting the sites list. Filters will appear in each group as sites are added that match the filters.

### Service Level
This lets you filter sites by their [site plan](/docs/site-plan/).

### Tags
You can add custom tags by selecting the checkbox next to the site, and clicking **Tags** and **Add Tag(s)**, then entering the tag.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p>Tags are case-sensitve.
</p>
</div>

To remove tags, select the site(s) you want to remove and follow the procedure above, this time selecting **Remove Tag**, or by hovering over the tag and clicking the **x** that appears.

### Upstream
Use this filter to sort sites by their upstream. This includes both [Pantheon upstreams](/docs/start-state/#pantheon-upstreams) and [Custom Upstreams](/docs/custom-upstream/).

### Code Status
This filter shows which sites have core updates available, which ones are up to date, and which ones are unknown (e.g., managed by Composer). At this time, Organizations with over 800 sites do not have access to this filter, as they will time out loading.

### Status

This filter shows any sites that are [frozen](/docs/platform-considerations/#inactive-site-freezing), or awaiting upgrade to the [Global CDN](/docs/global-cdn/).

### User in Charge
Filters sites by the [user in charge](/docs/change-management/#roles-and-permissions).


## Add Users to Your Organization

Organization Administrators can add members to the Organization Team as follows:

1. Click on the **People tab**.
2. Click **Add user**.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Choose the user's role.
5. Click **Add user**.

If the person does not yet have a Pantheon account, they will receive an email with an invitation to create one. Once they have successfully created an account, they will be automatically added to the Organization. If they already have an account, they will receive an email with a link to the Organization's dashboard.
