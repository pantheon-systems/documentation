Pantheon is not web hosting. It is a highly-tuned, distributed, and instantly scalable web platform. Pantheon also integrates development best practices and tools into the platform, to get the developer back to writing code, not configuring servers and carrying pagers.

Our tech includes NGINX, PHP, Redis, Varnish, Solr and Git&mdash;common tools in web development. You don't have to configure them, but an understanding of how they interact with your applications on Pantheon is important. Review the following must-read list to ensure developer success.
