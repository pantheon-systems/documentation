      You will _likely_ although not neccesarily want to take the following actions after updating to this version:

      * Go into Localdev's Configuration pane and initiate a _Factory Reset_
      * Remove the _entire_ Pantheon Localdev config directory `rm -rf ~/.pantheonlocaldev/`

      You may additionally wish to:

      * Remove any local codebases you have previously pulled for use with Localdev `rm -rf ~/Localdev`
      * Run `docker ps` and then `docker rm -f` to remove any lingering Pantheon containers

      Other Considerations:

      * It may be valuable to review the [Lando Pantheon Documentation](https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/pantheon.html) as some changes have been made and some nice features added.
      * If your Landofile has a good degree of custom magicks in it we recommended you review the [Update Guide](https://docs.devwithlando.io/guides/updating-to-rc2.html) to make sure that it is compatible with newer versions of Lando.

      * If you have an app running before upgrading you will need to restart it for the `pantheonlocal.com` domain name change to take place
      * If you have previously installed Pantheon Localdev you will likely want to make sure that it is not running the older version of the proxy otherwise PLD will likely assign port `8000` and `444` for the new `pantheonlocal.com` domain. The easiest way to make sure this is not the case is to click `Stop All` on the Pantheon Localdev dashboard and run `docker stop landoproxyhyperion5000gandalfedition_proxy_1` before starting up an app.
