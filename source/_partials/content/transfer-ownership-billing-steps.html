<p>If a credit card is already associated with the site, site ownership can not be transferred.</p>
<p>To temporarily remove the card and enable ownership transfer:</p>
<ol>
 <li>From the Pantheon Site Dashboard, click <strong><span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Settings</strong>.</li>
 <li>In the <strong>Your Credit Cards</strong> section, change the selected credit card to <strong>Do not bill this site to a card.</strong> and click <strong>Update Payment Method</strong>.
 <li>Continue with the steps below for when there is no credit card associated with the site.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>If there is no existing credit card already associated with the site:</p>
<ol>
 <li>From the Pantheon Site Dashboard, click <strong><span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Team</strong>.</li>
 <li> In the <strong>Team Members</strong> section, add the new Site Owner's email address and click <strong>Add to Team</strong>. A green checkmark notification appears and the name and email show below.</li>
 <li>To the right of the user's name and email, click the <strong>Make Owner</strong> link.</li>
 <li>A popup asks "Are you sure?" and asks for confirmation. Follow the instructions and click the red button to continue changing the Site Owner.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enterprise Organizations can use the same process to assume ownership of a site; however, Agency Partners do not have the ability to own sites directly.</p>
<p>Resellers should contact Pantheon Support directly to transfer ownership.</p>
