<h3> Why does Pantheon recommend CNAME records?</h3>

<p><code>CNAME</code> records point domains at other domains, instead of IP addresses. Using <code>CNAME</code> records means your DNS configuration is more stable in the event of a hardware change that updates IP addresses on the platform. Pantheon manages our own DNS records, and will update the <code>A</code> record for the platform domain your <code>CNAME</code> record is pointed to immediately.</p>
