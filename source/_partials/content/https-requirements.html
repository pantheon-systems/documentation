<h3>Requirements for Automated Certificate Renewal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All A/AAAA/CNAME/DNAME DNS records for any Pantheon-hosted domains (<code>example.com</code>) and/or subdomains (<code>www.example.com</code> or <code>blog.example.com</code>) must point to Pantheon's servers so Let's Encrypt can verify domain ownership.</li>
  <li>AAAA records are not required, but if set must exclusively point to Pantheon.</li>
  <li>Authoritative Name Servers must serve mixed-case lookups, and must not fail CAA lookups.</li>
  <li>CAA records must either 1) not exist for the domain and its parent domains or 2) authorize Let's Encrypt. Note that CAA records are inherited by subdomains.</li>
</ul>
