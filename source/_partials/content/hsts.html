Using the <a href="/docs/pantheon-yml/"><code>pantheon.yml</code></a> file, you can set the use and duration of the HSTS header, and its affect on subdomains. You can set a short (5 minute) duration header that affects just the domain, or a long (366 day) duration that also applies to subdomains. Using the long duration setting will help you get an A+ SSL rating from <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" class="external">SSL Labs</a>.

Use of the HSTS header is defined by the <code>scheme</code> directive, and takes three possible values:

<ul>
<li>No redirect and no HSTS header (default):

    <pre><code class="hljs less">scheme: any</code></pre></li>

<li>HTTPS redirect with a short HSTS duration (5 minutes):

    <pre><code class="hljs less">scheme: https</code></pre></li>

<li>HTTPS redirect with a long HSTS duration (366 days, for an A+ SSL Labs rating), which also applies to subdomains:

    <pre><code class="hljs less">scheme: hsts</code></pre></li>
</ul>

Pantheon will send the following header based on the setting of `scheme`:

<ul>
<li>any: <i>None</i></li>
<li>https: <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=300</code></li>
<li>hsts: <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31622400; includeSubDomains; preload</code></li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="/docs/pantheon-yml/">Pantheon YAML Configuration Files</a> for more information on how to configure this file.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
<h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p>Once enabled, HSTS headers are cached by browsers for the duration of the max-age period (one year on Pantheon). If at any time you wish to disable https and go back to unencrypted HTTP, users who have already visited your site will receive a browser warning preventing them from accessing the site until the max-age expires or they have manually cleared their browser history related to your site.</p>
<p>
If you are not sure that this is what you want, then you should select <code>scheme: https</code> instead, as this selection has no affect on subdomains, and has a limited (5 minute) HSTS duration.
