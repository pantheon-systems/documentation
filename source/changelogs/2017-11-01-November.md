## Platform Improvements
### Sites Requiring Upgrade to Global CDN Now Shown on User & Org Dashboards
Over 200,000 sites are already on [Pantheon's Global CDN](/global-cdn), but if you still have sites pointing to the legacy, deprecated infrastructure, you can now see which sites need an upgrade from your User or Organization Dashboard. Find the required DNS information from the **Domains / HTTPS** tab on each site environment. Complete the upgrade as soon as possible, and let us know if you have any questions.

Global CDN now respects the `no-store` directive in the `cache-control` header.

### Site Dashboard Update
On newly created sites, you are now directed to install your WordPress or Drupal CMS as the next step.
