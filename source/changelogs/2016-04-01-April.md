## Platform Improvements

### Workflow Tab Renamed to Database / Files   
We changed the name of the tab to reduce ambiguity.  

### Documentation Site Updates
We improved navigation on the [docs site](https://pantheon.io/docs/) by removing the drop-down options from the sub-navigation menu, and added links to the home page to view all tags, all categories, and all docs.

### New Terminus Plugins for Quicksilver Integrations
[Terminus Quicksilver Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-quicksilver-plugin): Helps you with the initial Quicksilver/Pantheon YAML setup  
[Terminus Secrets Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-secrets-plugin): Makes it easier to manage a secrets.json file so you don't have to check your cloud API keys into your codebase.

### Terminus 0.11.1 Released
If you haven't updated in a while, check out the [Terminus Changelog](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and get the [latest version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/releases).
