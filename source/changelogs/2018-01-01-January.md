![GCP and Pantheon Logo](../images/gcp.png)

Pantheon has switched infrastructure providers from Rackspace to Google Cloud Platform. This switch requires no downtime, as we actually did it *six months ago*! Read the announcement [here](https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-moves-google-cloud-platform).

## Platform Improvements

### PHP Upgrades
We've upgraded to PHP [5.6.33](http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.33), [7.0.27](http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.0.27), [7.1.13](http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.1.13), and [7.2.1](http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.2.1). See our documentation to learn how to [upgrade your PHP version](/php-versions).

### WP-CLI Upgrades
WP-CLI on Pantheon has been upgraded to [1.5.0](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2018/01/31/version-1-5-0-released/), which resolves "Error: Site not found" failures often seen when clearing caches on WordPress Site Networks.

### WordPress Core Upgrade
