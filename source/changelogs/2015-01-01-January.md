## Platform Improvements

### Supporting Organizations/Multi-Org
Need to collaborate with an agency? We've made it simple to add them to your organization. For more details, see blog post [Ready to Start Working with an Agency?](https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/ready-start-working-agency-thats-now-incredibly-simple)

### PHP Upgrade
We upgraded from PHP 5.3 to 5.3.29. This is the [last release](https://secure.php.net/archive/2014.php#id2014-08-14-1) for 5.3 and current users are encouraged, if possible, to [upgrade to 5.5](/php-versions) in your site's Dashboard.

### Concerned about CVE-2015-0235 aka "GHOST"?
There's no need. Customer application containers and database servers that were already on up-to-date versions were not vulnerable to GHOST.  Backing services were quickly patched, and our engineers further refined our patch deployment capability for even faster responses to future vulnerabilities. For more details, see related [Incident Report for Platform Operations](https://status.pantheon.io/incidents/z4l03w9rf3z7)
