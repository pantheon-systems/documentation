## Platform Improvements
### Testing SEO Now Supported on Platform Domains
Site Auditor (aka RavenCrawler) can now [access platform domains](/bots-and-indexing#indexing-your-pantheon-site) to support pre-release SEO testing. Please [contact support](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/#support) if you would like to see other tools given this access.

### OCSP Stapling Enabled on Global CDN
[OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) is an improved method for quickly and safely checking the validity of certificates for HTTPS. You can use [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com) (e.g. [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=pantheon.io](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=pantheon.io)) and search for "stapling" to see it's enabled. OCSP responses are typically good for about 7 days, so a response will only get updated as its validity lifetime expiration time approaches.
