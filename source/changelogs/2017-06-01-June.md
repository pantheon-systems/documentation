## Platform Improvements
### Pantheon Upstream Configuration
Organizations utilizing a [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream) can now set default site configurations, such as [nested docroot](/nested-docroot), in the `pantheon.upstream.yml` file. For details, see [Pantheon YAML Configuration Files](/pantheon-yml).

### Default PHP Versions
New [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/pull/123) and [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/189) sites now run PHP 7 by default. [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/pull/107) sites will default to PHP 5.6.

### Core Upgrades
[Drupal 8.3.4](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.3.4), [Drupal 7.56](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.56), and [WordPress 4.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/) have been pushed to all Site Dashboards.

[Drupal 8.3.3 and above hooks into the Pantheon service provider](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/186), to support operations such as clearing Pantheon’s edge cache when Drupal cache is rebuilt.

### WP-CLI

### New Relic

New Relic's APM Availability Monitoring has [known incompatibilities](/guides/new-relic) with SNI, which our HTTPS uses. Instead, we recommend configuring the free availability monitoring service within New Relic’s Synthetics Lite tool. For details, refer to [New Relic APM Pro](/guides/new-relic/).
