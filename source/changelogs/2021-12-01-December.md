## Platform Improvements

### Drupal 9.2.8

[Drupal 9.2.8](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.2.8) is now available for production sites. [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) sites on Pantheon use [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer), enabling one-click core updates through the Dashboard. To check for available updates, click **Check Now** from the Site Dashboard **Dev** tab.

Drupal 9.2.x will receive security coverage until June 15, 2022. Sites on 9.1.x or earlier should update to [Drupal 9.1.13](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.1.11).


### Drupal 8.9.20

[Drupal 8.9.20](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.20) is now available on the Pantheon platform. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates). Customers still using Drupal 8 on the Pantheon platform are strongly encouraged to upgrade to Drupal 9. Refer to the [upgrade documentation](/guides/drupal-9-migration/upgrade-to-d9) for more information. 



### WordPress 5.8.2

[WordPress 5.8.2](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/wordpress-5-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/) is available on the Pantheon platform. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates). This security and maintenance release features two [bug fixes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?id=54129%2C54323%2C54207&milestone=5.8.2&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority) in addition to one [security fix](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54207).

This release fixes security vulnerabilities and users are urged to upgrade their sites immediately.
