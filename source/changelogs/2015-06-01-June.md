## Platform Improvements

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Release
We added two new features to help security conscious organizations work with our platform:

[**SAML Login**](/sso): For organizations with SAML compatible single sign-on solutions, Pantheon allows authentication of users to the Dashboard via your own login system, giving you central administrative control over employee access to the platform.

### Improved Workflows Notifications
We are now providing richer and more accurate information about the background actions the Pantheon platform is performing on your sites.  This includes commits, workflow actions and clear caches, including more details about the tasks that were performed.

### WalkMe Tours
This week we added WalkMe.comâ€™s guidance platform. You can now search the docs from within the Dashboard and take tours to learn how to use the Pantheon platform.
