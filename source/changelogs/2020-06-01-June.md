## Platform Improvements

### Go Live Enhancements

You now always have the capability to provision HTTPS before going live. DNS challenges are now also shown on the dashboard, which were previously only available via Terminus. For more see our [Launch Essentials Guide](/guides/launch).

### Drupal 9.0

Drupal 9.0.0 is coming soon! If you want to try out Drupal 9 on Pantheon now, check out our [Early Access doc](/drupal-9) where we have instructions for testing with Build Tools or Integrated Composer.

### Localdev 0.10.0

[Localdev 0.10.0](/guides/localdev/changelog) has been released, including a new log and activity viewer, UX improvements, and bug fixes. For more information, see the [Localdev documentation](/guides/localdev).

### Global CDN

Global CDN now blocks requests identified as being performed by AspiegelBot (aka PetalBot) when a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) is present. This platform-wide change is intended to guard against resource exhaustion and related site downtime. Going forward these requests will result in a 403 and will not count as site traffic for Pages Served and Visits. For more information see [Traffic Limits and Overages](/guides/account-mgmt/traffic).

Capacity Expansion: Auckland, New Zealand (AKL).
