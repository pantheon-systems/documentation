## Platform Improvements


### Freezing Inactive Sites  
Sandbox sites that have not been used in six months will be frozen due to inactivity. But donâ€™t worry--you can click **Unfreeze Site** on your Dashboard if you still need it.

### Docs Site Changes
We updated the Docs landing page to show the five top docs in each category, added a Featured category to give you quick access to the most frequently used docs, and simplified the URLs. [Check it out](https://pantheon.io/docs/)!

### Terminus 0.11.0 Released
If you haven't updated in a while, check out the [Terminus Changelog](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and get the [latest version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/releases).
