### Drupal Core Upgrades

 that you upgrade immediately.

### Terminus 1.3.0

If you haven’t updated in awhile, checkout the [Terminus Changelog](/terminus/updates/#changelog) to see what’s new and update to the [current release](/terminus/updates/#update-to-the-current-release-)

In some cases, ssh operations to the platform would hang on connection if a user has ed25519 ssh keys in their agent keychain. This bug has been fixed. Note that we still don’t support ed25519 keys.
