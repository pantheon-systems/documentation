## Community Updates
Pantheon has launched our new [Community Forum](https://discuss.pantheon.io)!  In addition to the ephemeral and fast-moving Slack channel, the new forum gives the community a place for long-form discussions, problem-solving, and engagement.

Moving forward, we’ll update you in this newsletter with the [hottest topics and discussions](https://discuss.pantheon.io/top) happening in the community.

## Pantheon Heroes
We’re also excited to announce our new advocacy program, [Pantheon Heroes](https://community.pantheon.io/). If you love Pantheon, the Open Web, and helping others, [apply for Hero Status](https://community.pantheon.io/#apply) so we can help you help the world.
