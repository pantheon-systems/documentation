## Platform Improvements
### Improve Email Deliverability with SPF records
While we still recommend using a third-party email solution, for those who choose to use Pantheon's built-in message transfer agent (MTA), you may now set up an SPF record for your domain and include Pantheon's mail relays for improved delivery. For details, see: <a href="/docs/email/#are-there-spf-records-for-pantheons-local-mta-postfix" data-proofer-ignore>Email on Pantheon</a>.

### Drupal Maintenance Mode ImageCache Fix
Fixed an issue where image derivatives (ImageCache, image styles) were not generating successfully in Drupal maintenance mode.

### Drupal 8.6.1 
Update to Drupal 8.6.1. For more information, see <https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.6.1>.
