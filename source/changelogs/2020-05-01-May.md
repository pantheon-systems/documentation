## Platform Improvements

### Early Access to Drupal 9 With Integrated Composer

You don’t have to wait until June to give Drupal 9 a whirl! Pantheon is offering early access to test out Pantheon’s new Integrated Composer support. Visit the [Community Forum](https://discuss.pantheon.io/t/early-access-to-drupal-9-0-with-integrated-composer/1110) for details. Why worry about running `composer install` when our platform can do that for you as part of a build step.
