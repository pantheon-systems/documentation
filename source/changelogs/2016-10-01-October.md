## Platform Improvements

### Terminus 1.0 Alpha Release
Terminus 1.0 alpha was released to everyone who registered to help us with testing. We’d love you to test Terminus 1.0 alpha as well and/or share the release with experienced Terminus users who may not have signed up to test! To install, follow the instructions in the [Terminus Manual](/terminus/install). The manual addresses many questions about this release, but if you have ideas for how to improve the documentation or find things that are missing or unclear, please click "Contribute" at the top left of the doc and then "Report doc issue".


### Custom Domains in Multidev Environments
You can now add custom domain names to your Multidev environments. Among other use cases, this allows you to use your company’s name in a URL when you show your work to customers or others in your organization.


### Solr Power for WordPress 0.6 Update
We released an update for the [Solr Power WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/solr-power/) that adds advanced WP_Query integration and a method for API status. To contribute or offer input, please open an issue or pull request on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power).
