## Platform Improvements

### Drupal 9.2.7

[Drupal 9.2.7](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.2.7) is now available for production sites. [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) sites on Pantheon use [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer), enabling one-click core updates through the Dashboard. To check for available updates, click **Check Now** from the Site Dashboard **Dev** tab.

Drupal 9.2.x will receive security coverage until June 15, 2022. Sites on 9.1.x or earlier should update to [Drupal 9.1.13](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.1.11).


## Documentation

[Convert a Standard Drupal 8 Site to a Composer Managed Site](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/composer-convert) - Upgrade a standard Drupal 8 site, by converting it to a Composer-managed Drupal 8 site on the new Integrated Composer framework. The documentation provides a guide for converting a standard Drupal 8 site using `drops-8` to the new Integrated Composer `drupal9` upstream while remaining on Drupal 8.

[Using Solr 8 on Drupal 9](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/solr-drupal/solr-drupal-9) -  Pantheon Search with Solr 8 is currently in Limited Availability. Pantheon Search derives from Apache Solr 8 and gives Drupal 9 web teams a high-performance search index integrated with [Integrated Composer's](/guides/integrated-composer) easy one-click updates.
