### WordPress Core Upgrade
[WordPress 4.9.5](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/) has been pushed to all WordPress site dashboards.

Pantheon's update to WordPress 4.9.5 included a customization to the WordPress login form, which shows a button to "Return to Pantheon" to help with the first time user experience. Additional information is available [here](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/issues/155).

### Drupal Core Upgrades
[Drupal 8.5.1](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.1) has been pushed to all Drupal 8 site dashboards. This release is classified as a security release and all users are urged to upgrade their sites as soon as possible.

[Drupal 7.58](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.58) has been pushed to all Drupal 7 site dashboards. This release is classified as a security release and all users are urged to upgrade their sites as soon as possible.

[Drupal 6.40](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-6/pull/17) has been pushed to all Drupal 7 site dashboards. This release is classified as a security release and all users are urged to upgrade their sites as soon as possible.

### Global CDN `Surrogate-Key-Raw` Disabled by Default
The `Surrogate-Key-Raw` header, used for debugging when using [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://pantheon.io/features/advanced-caching),  is no longer sent by default.  To receive this header when making a request, send the `Pantheon-Debug: 1` header, like so:

```bash
curl -IsH "Pantheon-Debug:1" https://example.com | grep key
```

This change addressed an issue that caused Twitter card validation to fail, and also reduces overall page size and speeds up page load time when sending many keys.
