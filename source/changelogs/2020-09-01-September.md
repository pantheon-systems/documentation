## Platform Improvements

### Drupal 9.0

[Drupal 9](/drupal-9) is available for early access testing with new or existing sites. We don't recommend fully switching a live site to Drupal 9 until we have upgraded our version of MariaDB.

### Drupal 8.9.3

Drupal 8.9.3 is now available on the Pantheon platform. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates). For more information, see the [Drupal 8.9.3](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.3) release notes.

### WordPress 5.5

WordPress 5.5 has been released on the Pantheon platform. This version of WordPress introduces a new method, `[wp_get_environment_type()](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/24/new-wp_get_environment_type-function-in-wordpress-5-5/)`, which returns whether your site is running on a live, test or development environment. Pantheon supports this method, so it will return the correct value on any site that has upgraded to WordPress 5.5.
