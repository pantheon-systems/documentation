## Platform Improvements

### Machine Token Authentication
You can now authenticate with Terminus using machine tokens! This means usernames and passwords are no longer required to use the command line. [Create yours now](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/users/#account/tokens/).

### Pantheon HUD Plugin
We released the [Pantheon HUD plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-hud/). This plugin will:   
- Remind you what environment you're in and let you jump to the others  
- Show some status data about the environment  
- Give you a copy/paste Terminus WP-CLI command starter    
A big thanks to Daniel Bachhuber (of WP-CLI fame) for putting this together. Development is taking place on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-hud/), and as always your pull requests and issues with feature ideas are welcome!

### Quicksilver Platform Hooks Are Now Available
* Quicksilver opens up our platform and allows deeper integration and automation by adding hooks for encoding reactions to specific platform workflows. Common uses so far include:
* Automatically sanitizing databases after cloning content from Live
* Marking deployments in New Relic to track improvements or regressions
* Posting notifications to Slack of platform actions  
[Learn more about Quicksilver](/quicksilver) or check out the examples on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples).
