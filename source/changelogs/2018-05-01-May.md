## Platform Improvements
### Duplicate Pantheon Sites with Terminus Site Clone
The new [Terminus Site Clone](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-site-clone-plugin) plugin makes it easier than ever to duplicate sites on Pantheon. For details, see <a href="/docs/migrate/#how-do-i-clone-an-existing-pantheon-site" data-proofer-ignore>Migrate Sites to Pantheon FAQs</a>.
### PHP 7.2 MS SQL Support
The platform-wide build of PHP 7.2 now supports connecting to an external Microsoft SQL server via [sqlsrv functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.sqlsrv.php). Your CMS should use Pantheon's default database, but this unlocks use cases that require connecting to an external MS SQL server.
### Upgrade to PHP 7.1 or 7.2 before December
PHP 5.5 and 5.3 have reached end-of-life (EOL), and PHP 5.6 and 7.0 will reach EOL in December 2018 so [upgrade to PHP 7.1 or 7.2](/php-versions) as soon as possible.
### PHP Updates
PHP has been upgraded to [5.6.36](http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.36), [7.0.30](
http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.0.30), [7.1.17](http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.1.17) and [7.2.5](
http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.2.5) platform-wide.
### WordPress Core Upgrade
[WordPress 4.9.6](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/pull/159) has been pushed to all site dashboards.
### Filemount Configuration
Use the filemount configuration to modify the default location of Pantheon's cloud-based filesystem. For details, see [Pantheon YAML Configuration Files](/pantheon-yml/#filemount-path).
