## Platform Improvements

### Webinars
Tired of typing support requests on how to use the platform? No question is ignored on our [Essential Technical Training Webinar](https://pantheon.io/pantheon-essential-training), which will be held weekly starting on Thursday, June 18, at 10:00 a.m. PST. [Register here](https://pantheon.io/essential-developer-training). Let your team know this resource is always available.

### Dashboard Load Times
We've been optimizing Dashboard load times, specifically for the Site Dashboard. Things are looking much better. Have you noticed a difference? We'd love to hear your feedback. What is the WORST thing about using Pantheon?

### Free Backups
