## Platform Improvements
### Terminus 1.0
After months of retooling and feedback from users, we're excited to officially release Terminus 1.0! This release comes with a commitment to backwards compatibility for scripts and plugins, as well as a new core engine based on Symfony Console. Everything you've been doing with Terminus is included in this new version with more additions continually coming! [Learn more about this new feature](https://pantheon.io/features/command-line-interface) and check out the [Terminus Manual](/terminus).

### Terminus Plugins
The open plugin architecture of Terminus allows developers to extend it’s functionality and [create new commands](/terminus/plugins/create). For a list of supported plugins, take a look at our new [Plugin Directory](/terminus/plugins/directory) in the docs.

#### Mass Updates
[The Mass Update plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-mass-update) applies all available upstream updates to a list of sites. This allows users who manage a lot of sites to easily stay on top of Drupal and WordPress core updates.

### Build Tools
[This Terminus plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin) contains a collection of six additional commands useful during the build step on a Pantheon site that uses a GitHub PR workflow.

#### Filer
[Terminus Filer](https://github.com/terminus-plugin-project/terminus-filer-plugin) is named as such because it’s an easy way to launch your SFTP client with all the connection details “filled” in.

#### Rsync
The [Terminus Rsync Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-rsync-plugin) makes it easy to copy files between your local computer and Pantheon. Once installed, you can use rsync as you normally would to transfer files, wrapped in Terminus commands.

### WordPress 4.7.2 Upgrade
This is a security patch put out by WordPress and made available as a one-click upgrade in the Pantheon Site Dashboard. We suggest all users upgrade immediately if you haven’t already. See our [Status Post](https://status.pantheon.io/incidents/xb3w9xc5fdgp) for more information.

### Drupal 8.2.5 Upgrade
This is a minor version update, which nonetheless closes several dozen issues. See [Drupal’s Release Page](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.5) for more information.
