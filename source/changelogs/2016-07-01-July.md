## Platform Improvements

### Migrating WordPress Sites to Pantheon Just Got Easier
As of July 28, now when you choose **Migrate Existing Site** and select WordPress, youâ€™ll be guided to install the Pantheon Migrations plugin, so you can get your migration going with just a few clicks. [Learn more](/migrate).

### TLS 1.0 Deprecated
In keeping with the recommendations of PCI DSS, we no longer support TLS 1.0 for customer sites. [Older browsers and mobile devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Web_browsers) that do not support TLS 1.1 and 1.2 will likely experience problems and security vulnerabilities. If you need to continue support for TLS 1.0, you can do so with [Cloudflare](/cloudflare). For details, see[ Cloudflare's documentation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205043158-PCI-3-1-and-TLS-1-2).

### Drupal Contrib Module Security Updates
There were multiple releases of Drupal contributed modules that fix highly critical remote code execution vulnerabilities. The Drupal Security Team urges you to update the modules immediately. See [more information on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2016-001).

### Terminus 0.11.2
