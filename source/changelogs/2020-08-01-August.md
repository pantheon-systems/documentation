## Platform Improvements

### Dedicated Certificates & Updated Go-live

All Pantheon customers are now provisioned with a dedicated certificate for HTTPS for each custom domain on a site environment. In addition, the go-live experience has been optimized and now lets you configure HTTPS before launch via the [DNS TXT method](/domains#add-a-custom-domain) to verify domain ownership.

### Multidev and COVID Response Site Offers

Pantheonâ€™s [Multidev](/multidev) and [COVID Response site](/crisis-response-upstream) offers have been extended to Sept 1, 2020.

### Drupal 9.0

[Drupal 9](/drupal-9) is available for early access testing with new or existing sites. We don't recommend fully switching a live site to Drupal 9 until we have upgraded our version of MariaDB.

### Drupal 8.9.2 

Drupal 8.9.2 is now available on the Pantheon platform. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates). For more information, see the [Drupal 8.9.2](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.2) release notes.
