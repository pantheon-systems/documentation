## Platform Improvements


### WordPress Launch Check
WordPress Launch Check is an automated report you can run to make sure your site is ready to launch—built right in to the Pantheon Dashboard or available as a [WP-CLI](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp_launch_check) extension. For more details, see related blog post [Announcing WordPress Launch Check](https://pantheon.io/blog/announcing-wordpress-launch-check).

### WordPress core Updates to 4.2.1
WordPress 4.2 came out this month to great fanfare. For more details, see [Version 4.2 announcement](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2). A few days later, the core team released a security update. We were on it, and the most recent version is available in all Pantheon WordPress Site Dashboards. We recommend updating all of your WordPress sites as soon as possible.

### Edge Cache Configuration Update
Previously, if you ran a Google AdWords campaign that included a redirect before users landed on your marketing content, your reports included PANTHEON_STRIPPED
in place of the campaign attributes in the original URL.  Now you will no longer experience PANTHEON_STRIPPED normalization in any of your Google Analytics reports.

### SAML Users
Single-sign on customers now have a dedicated log in page. Learn more about [SAML For Pantheon Agencies](/sso).

### Fedora Update
We’ve officially completed a fleet-wide codeserver update to [Fedora 20](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/20/html/Release_Notes/).

### Styx-to-Appserver Encryption
We now have encryption for routing to appserver, so if you’re running HTTPS you will automatically have end-to-end encryption on non-free sites.

Learn how to synchronize your existing Pantheon site to GitHub, create repositories, synchronize existing GitHub repositories with Pantheon, and develop collaboratively by using branching and pull requests.

Two-factor authentication (TFA) is a security practice that prevents attackers from compromising accounts by requiring an extra authentication method beyond only using a password to log in.  Our [new guide](/guides/two-factor-authentication) will walk you through installing two-factor authentication on Drupal and WordPress, for both the single site and organization-wide cases.
