## Platform Improvements

### Multidev and COVID Response Site Offers

Pantheon’s [Multidev](/guides/multidev) and [COVID Response site](/crisis-response-upstream) offers have been extended to Sept 1, 2020.

<!-- excerpt -->

### Terminus 2.4.0

[Terminus 2.4.0](/terminus) has been released. See the [release notes](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/2.4.0) for more information.

### Drupal 9.0

Drupal 9 was released last month on drupal.org. Pantheon Co-Founder Matthew Cheney [wrote on our blog about the significance of this release for the Drupal community](https://pantheon.io/blog/drupal-9-launch).

### Localdev 0.10.1

[Localdev 0.10.1](/guides/localdev/changelog) has been released, including a bug fix for Terminus authentication. For more information, see the [Localdev documentation](/guides/localdev).

### Drupal 8.9.1, 8.8.8, and 7.72

Drupal 8.9.1, Drupal 8.8.8, and Drupal 7.72 are now available on the Pantheon platform. These are security releases; all sites are urged to update as soon as possible. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates). For more information, see the [Drupal 8.9.1](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.1), [Drupal 8.8.8](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.8.8), and [Drupal 7.72](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.72) release notes.

### WordPress 5.4.2

[WordPress 5.4.2](https://wordpress.org/news/2020/06/wordpress-5-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/) is now available on the Pantheon platform. As part of this release, Pantheon also rolled out a configuration change to [block xmlrpc by default](/wordpress-best-practices#disable-xml-rpc-via-pantheonyml). If your site uses xmlrpc, [re-enable it](/pantheon-yml#protected-web-paths-override) before deploying this release to production.

### Traffic Metrics

Although it places load on the platform, Pantheon now excludes traffic from [Petalbot](https://aspiegel.com/petalbot), which would otherwise count towards your website's total traffic.  

## Documentation

### [Traffic Overages and the Site Plan](/guides/account-mgmt/traffic)

Offers a concise reference for understanding site traffic and site plans.

### [Metrics in the Site Dashboard](/guides/legacy-dashboard/metrics)

#### &

### [Traffic Limits and Overages](/guides/account-mgmt/traffic)

Updates to both of these docs help clarify what Pantheon counts as site visits and pages served, and make Pantheon’s policies regarding overages more transparent.

### Inclusive Language

As part of our commitment to more inclusive language, Pantheon recently switched to using `blocklist`/`allowlist`, and [pantheon.io/docs](https://pantheon.io/docs) has renamed its default Git branch to `main`.
