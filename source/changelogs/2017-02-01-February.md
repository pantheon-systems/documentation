## Platform Improvements

### PHP Upgrade
We upgraded PHP to [5.6.30](https://secure.php.net/archive/2017.php#id2017-01-19-3) and [7.0.15](https://secure.php.net/archive/2017.php#id2017-02-16-1). See our documentation to learn how to [upgrade your PHP version](/php-versions).

### Drupal Core Upgrade
[Drupal 8.2.6](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.6) and [Drupal 7.54](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.54) releases have been pushed to all Pantheon dashboards.

### Patched for Linux Kernel Vulnerability
A [vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6074) in the Linux Kernel was discovered that could allow users to gain root privileges. The Pantheon platform was quickly updated to prevent this privilege escalation.
