## Platform Improvements

### 24/7 Chat Support
We upgraded the basic ticket experience by replacing it with [real time chat](https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-announces-247-chat-support). With chat, you get responses to your questions even faster by avoiding the inherent delays in ticket-based systems. In addition to providing support in a more real-time, consultative medium, we're also proud to announce that support is now staffed around the clock all year long, 24/7/365.

### Early Release: Pantheon Advanced Page Cache Plugin
For sites wanting fine-grained control over how their responses are represented in their edge cache, Pantheon Advanced Page Cache is the golden ticket. [Learn more](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/)


### Drupal 6 Long Term Support (LTS) Partners
At Pantheon, we are committed to helping our customers operate their Drupal 6 sites for as long as they are needed. We have selected two Long Term Support (LTS) partners to assist customers seeking to move their Drupal 6 sites to Pantheon. Read more about it in Lauren Kelly's [blog post](https://pantheon.io/blog/drupal-6-long-term-support-and-migration-partnerships).
