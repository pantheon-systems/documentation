## Platform Improvements
### Terminus Manual and Terminus 1.0 Beta Releases
Terminus 1.0 is now available as a public beta, complete with a [new manual](/terminus). In this release, we’ve updated the command structures and transitioned from a PHP based framework to Symfony Console. You can [compare differences here](/terminus/get-started/legacy). If you find bugs in the latest version, please [submit them along with feature requests here](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/issues/new?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTjJRMk1qRmpNbU5tWm1NMyIsInQiOiJMdzVaRGFCbXY5bEJHa2h4NE5FNlFiejBGdkxNZTFxUGphMUwxWXVocitoRTJoZUlDQVhlUnNaUDlWTjh1ZU5waU1tT3R2OHYzVGk3K2c4SnFzWWJBVm9KdUNSbzNXMFVwR1BIbGt2OUFoUTR1UkN5Q21rc0dUSEh5amo5WHlGaiJ9).
