## Platform Improvements

### Drupal 9 with One-click Composer Updates

Create and launch [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) sites on Pantheon with [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer/one-click-updates). Keep your Drupal 9 repository lean, avoid build artifacts on the main branch, and keep the one-click updates for both upstream commits & Composer dependencies that you have come to know and love with Pantheon.
