Intro paragraph

### How do we handle documentation that is still accurate but not recommended or relevant?

Example of Drupal 8 codebase guides.

### How do we handle documentation that people may search for but is not valid anymore?

Lockr example?

### How do we handle documentation for deprecated Pantheon features / plugins?

Edge integrations example that emphasizes that we've deprecated open source plugins / modules.
The capacities of the Pantheon platform those open source tools leaned on are still present.

### Is there a difference between "archiving" and "deprecating"?

Hmmm. Edge Integration repos are "archived," meaning they're not going to change while archived.

In the parlance of OSS, "deprecated" generally means something is going to be removed in the next version but it is still functional. (and I suppose could still change in some why prior to total removal)

Another difference here is the relationship to time. "Archived" communicates something about the past mostly. The thing *was* put in the archive (with the implication that it will not change in the present/future). 
"Deprecated" communicates something about the future (the thing will be removed / stop working in the future, because of a decision made in the past)
