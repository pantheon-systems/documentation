## Optimized for Velocity

The best balance of people, processes, and platform technology is always shifting, even as the primary forces shaping that balance are fairly constant. The pressure to deliver more value leads to moving faster. The pressure to maintain stability can lead to moving slower.

Perhaps the most important breakthrough pioneered by the wider DevOps community was increasing safety and speed _together_. Instead of viewing the pressure to go fast and the pressure to stay stable as always opposed to each other, healthy DevOps teams find they can increase stability by making deployments a frequent occurrence. If the pressure to stay stable leads to rare deployments, then the fear of deployments builds. When deployments go from quarterly to monthly to weekly to daily to hourly and faster, the risks tend to go down. The unknown dangers of deployments get resolved as deployments happen more and more frequently.

The same virtuous cycle is possible through WebOps. Instead treating collaboration across IT and Marketing as a rare event happening only around big, drawn out relaunches, a WebOps team collaborates constantly. As the targets for success constantly move, a healthy team of cross-functional people uses an iterative process on top of a stable platform.
