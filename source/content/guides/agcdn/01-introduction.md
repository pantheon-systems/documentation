Advanced Global CDN is a Managed Service that takes Pantheon's content delivery network (CDN) offering a step forward. AGCDN is designed for customers that require unique optimizations for digital delivery at scale.

Each AGCDN service configuration is offered as an annual contract subscription. Customers can add multiple sites to their AGCDN configuration, or conditionally apply specific rules.

AGCDN provides teams with a way to:

- Block Malicious traffic

- Create Geofencing / IP restrictions

- Rate limits with a website firewall (only with [AGCDN with WAF / IO](/guides/agcdn/agcdn-wafio))

- Define valid user agent strings and query string sorting and filtering

- Extend enterprise-grade security

At the moment, AGCDN only works with custom domains. `.pantheonsite.io` domains are not covered.
