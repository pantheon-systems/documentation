This section provides solutions to common Drush troubleshooting scenarios.

### Reading the Pantheon Environment from Drush

Drush does not run using the web server. This makes reliance on the `$_SERVER` superglobal problematic as some of the contents of that array will be missing, for example `['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']`. Drush commands and policy files must reference `$_ENV` when reading Pantheon environment information. Refer to our documentation on [using the `$_SERVER` superglobal in custom code](/guides/environment-configuration/read-environment-config/#using-_server) for more information.

### Terminus Drush Silent Failure

The following silent failure occurs when executing `terminus drush` commands on environments that use redirect logic without checking to see if Drupal is running via the command line:

```bash
[notice] Command: <site>.<env> -- 'drush <command>' [Exit: 1]
[error]
```

Newer versions of Drush fail with the message: `[warning] Drush command terminated abnormally.` For example:

```bash
[warning] Drush command terminated abnormally.
[notice] Command: <site>.<env> -- 'drush <command>' [Exit: 1]
[error]
```

Redirects terminate the PHP process before the Drush execution is complete. You can resolve this error by adding `php_sapi_name() != "cli"` as a conditional statement to all redirect logic within `settings.php`:

```php:title=settings.php
// Require HTTPS, www.
if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']) &&
  ($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] === 'live') &&
  // Check if Drupal or WordPress is running via command line
  (php_sapi_name() != "cli")) {
  if ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] != 'www.yoursite.com' ||
      !isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT_HTTPS']) ||
      $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT_HTTPS'] != 'ON' ) {
    header('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
    header('Location: https://www.yoursite.com'. $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
    exit();
  }
}
```

### Drush Commands on Remote Aliases Not Working from Inside Local Drupal Install

Some Drush 5 commands must be executed from outside the context of a local Drupal installation, due to a [known issue with Drush 5](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/313). The output from a Drush 5 command run in this context looks like the following:

```bash{outputLines:2-8}
drush @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV status
 PHP configuration : /srv/bindings/754cbef0a7b54a07ab07167ef8de7377/php53.in
                        i
                        /srv/bindings/754cbef0a7b54a07ab07167ef8de7377/php53.in
                        i
 Drush version : 5.10.1
 Drush : /srv/bindings/754cbef0a7b54a07ab07167ef8de7377/drushrc.
 configuration php
```

Change your directory to a context outside of a working local Drupal installation to make your Drush 5 commands work on Pantheon aliases:

```bash{outputLines:2, 5, 6-31}
pwd
/Users/USERNAME/Sites/SITENAME
cd ..
pwd
/Users/USERNAME/Sites/
drush @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV status
 Drupal version : 7.26
 Site URI : ENV-SITENAME.pantheonsite.io
 Database driver : mysql
 Database hostname : 10.178.14.16
 Database username : pantheon
 Database name : pantheon
 Database : Connected
 Drupal bootstrap : Successful
 Drupal user : Anonymous

 Administration theme : seven
 PHP configuration : /srv/bindings/754cbef0a7b54a07ab07167ef8de7377/php5
                           3.ini
                           /srv/bindings/754cbef0a7b54a07ab07167ef8de7377/php5
                           3.ini
 Drush version : 5.10.1
 Drush configuration : /srv/bindings/754cbef0a7b54a07ab07167ef8de7377/drus
                           hrc.php

```

### Drush Error: "Unknown option: --db-url"

This error only affects Drupal 7 sites running a Drush version below Drush 8, and looks similar to the example below:

```bash{outputLines:2-3}
drush @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV cc all
Unknown option: --db-url. See `drush help cache-clear` for available [error]
options. To suppress this error, add the option --strict=0.
```

Follow the suggestion and add the option `--strict=0` to resolve this error:

```bash{outputLines:2-3}
drush @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV cc all --strict=0
'all' cache was cleared in [success]
/srv/bindings/BINDINGID/code#ENV-SITENAME.pantheonsite.io
```

### Drush Error: "No Drupal site found", "Could not find a Drupal settings.php file", or missing system information from status

This error looks similar to the example below.

```none
Could not find a Drupal settings.php file at ./sites/default/settings.php
```

You can add a default or empty `sites/default/settings.php` to your site's code to resolve this error.

### Unable to Connect to MySQL Server

You might encounter the following error when running Drush MySQL commands:

```none
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'dbserver.dev.SITE_ID.drush.in' (61)
```

This error response happens when an inactive site has spun down. Wake environments by loading the home page or with the following [Terminus](/terminus) command to resolve this error:

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus env:wake SITENAME.ENV
```

### Unable to Connect to drush.in Hostnames (DNS)

Some ISPs have issues resolving a `drush.in hostname;`. You can use the `dig` command to investigate if you're experiencing trouble connecting to a `drush.in hostname`.

```bash{outputLines:2-19}
dig appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in
;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.


; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: REFUSED, id: 38905
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0


;; QUESTION SECTION:
;appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in. IN A

```

In the example above, the REFUSED status suggests an incorrect resolution. The next step is to run `dig` with a specified DNS server. We recommend using Google's DNS (8.8.8.8):

```bash{outputLines:2-26}
dig @8.8.8.8 appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in
;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.


; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> @8.8.8.8 appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 36494
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 34, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0


;; QUESTION SECTION:
;appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in. IN A


;; ANSWER SECTION:
appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in. 599 IN A 67.207.144.213
...
appserver.live.38f2bd91-0000-46cb-9278-0000000000000.drush.in. 599 IN A 67.207.143.122


;; Query time: 52 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Thu Aug 30 13:02:00 2012
;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 622
```

In this example, Google's DNS is able to correctly resolve the `drush.in` hostname.

You can adjust your local settings to use Google's DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) instead of the default provided by your ISP to correctly resolve the host names.

### Timeouts When Using Long-Running Migrate or Other Drush Commands

Long-running Drush commands that produce no output will cause the SSH gateway to timeout. Pantheon's timeouts for SSH based commands are outlined in our [documentation on timeouts](/timeouts). Confirm that your commands return output to the terminal session in under 10 minutes to avoid a timeout related to a lack of output.

For example, using the `--feedback` flag:

```bash{promptUser: user}
drush migrate-import migration --feedback="1000 lines processed"
```

### Drush error: Failed opening required .../vendor/bin/includes/preflight.inc

This error indicates that the vendor directory contains Drush binaries that should be removed. Remove any Drush files from `vendor/bin` and `vendor/drush` using `git rm`.

```none
Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required '/srv/bindings/.../code/vendor/bin/includes/preflight.inc' (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear:/usr/share/php') in /srv/bindings/.../vendor/bin/drush.php on line 11
```

### Drush 11 error: Declaration of Drush\Sql\Sqlmysql::command() must be compatible with Drush\Sql\SqlBase::command()

This error can occur on Multidevs with a [site-local installation](/guides/drush/drush-versions#site-local-drush-usage) version of Drush 11 that removes the Drush version from the `pantheon.yml` file. This error occurs because the Multidev does not recognize that there is a site-local installation and attempts to use the Pantheon-installed version (which by default is Drush 8.4.12).

You can add a compatible Drush version in your `pantheon.yml` file to refresh the environment as a potential workaround. For Drupal 9 and later, add `drush_version: 10` to the `pantheon.yml` file.

### Drush GDPR Dumper Error
[Drush GDPR Dumper](https://github.com/druidfi/drush-gdpr-dumper) is incompatible with MariaDB and breaks the `drush-sql-dump` command, resulting in following error: `The '--column-statistics' option does not exist.`

This package ships it's own `mysqldump` file to do the MySQL dump and overrides the `extra-dump` configuration, which is passed to `mysqldump` and does not allow it's alteration.

To fix this error, remove the `mysqldump` file or uninstall the package. Then the platform's version of `mysqldump` will be used instead.
