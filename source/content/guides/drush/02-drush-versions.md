This section provides information on Drush versions and site-local usage.

Pantheon runs Drush versions based on your Drupal version:

- **Drupal (Latest Version)**: Drush 10 (for newly created sites)
- **Drupal 7**: Drush 8 (for newly created sites)

## Available Drush Versions

<Partial file="drush-supported.md" />

We recommend managing your site through Composer. Visit the [Build Tools Workflow](/guides/build-tools/) for information on how to use Composer to manage Drupal sites on Pantheon, or the [Convert to Composer](/guides/composer-convert) guide to convert an existing site to a Composer-managed site.

## Verify Current Drush Version

You can use [Terminus](/terminus/) to verify the current version of Drush running on your Pantheon site:

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus drush <site>.<env> -- status | grep "Drush version"
```

## Compatibility and Requirements

<Partial file="drush-compatibility.md" />

## Configure Drush Version

1. Refer to [Available Drush Versions](#available-drush-versions) and [Drush requirements](#compatibility-and-requirements) before you modify a site's Drush version. Remember that not all versions of Drush are compatible with all versions of Drupal.

1. Change your site's Drush version in the [`pantheon.yml` file](/pantheon-yml/):

    ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
    api_version: 1

    drush_version: 8
    ```

Now your site’s Drush version is managed via `pantheon.yml`. This allows Drush to be version controlled and deployed along with the rest of your code.


<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

Create the `pantheon.yml` file if it does not already exist. If a `pantheon.upstream.yml` file exists, do not edit it. It is used by the upstream updates repository and will cause a [merge conflict if modified](/core-updates#error-updating-conflict-modifydelete-pantheonupstreamyml-deleted-in-head-and-modified-in-upstreammaster-version-upstreammaster-of-pantheonupstreamyml-left-in-tree).

</Alert>

## Troubleshoot Your Drush Version

Occasionally, the correct version of Drush is not called even after updating the Drush version in `pantheon.yml`.

The Pantheon platform always prefers the site-local Drush or other local settings over the setting in the `pantheon.yml` file.

1. Check for an outdated configuration file, `policy.drush.inc`, in your local `~/.drush` directory.

1. Remove the file, or comment out its contents to resolve the issue.

Executing Drush on the platform via a `terminus drush` command will use the version of Drush specified in `pantheon.yml`, unless a site-local version is present.

### Site-local Drush Usage

We recommend that you use the latest version of Drupal with Drush 11 installed as a site-local Drush if you manage your site with Composer.

Our default Composer-managed upstream has a start state for this dependency that will also work with Drush 12 when it is released.

```bash{promptUser: user}
"drush/drush": "^11 || ^12"
```

Refer to [Pantheon's Drupal Composer-Managed upstream](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed/blob/main/composer.json#L23) for a complete example of the `composer.json` file.

#### Permissions

Site-local Drush requires executable permissions. Follow the steps below if you encounter `permission denied` errors when running Drush commands.

1. Adjust permissions on the Drush executable:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    chmod +x vendor/bin/drush
    ```

1. Commit and push this change to your Pantheon site.

### Drush 5 on Older Sites

Drupal sites created on Pantheon in late 2015 or earlier that do not have `drush_version` defined in `pantheon.yml` may default to Drush 5. In this case, you may see the following error:

```bash
{{Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect() in /etc/drush/drush-5-extensions/pantheon.drush.inc:127
```

Configure a newer version of Drush as [documented above](#configure-drush-version) to resolve this error.
