Drupal sites on Pantheon use [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) to allow one-click core updates.

<!-- belongs in source/partials/drupal/core-updates-partial.md, but it wasn't rendering. Edward 2022-05 -->

One-click core updates can be made through the Dashboard:

1. Navigate to **<span class="fa fa-code"></span> Code** in the **<span class="fa fa-wrench"></span> Dev** tab of your Site Dashboard.

1. Click **Check Now**.

1. Click **Apply Updates** if updates are available.
