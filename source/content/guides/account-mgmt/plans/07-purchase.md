<Tab title="Add New Card" id="add-cc-id" active={true}>

If this is your first time taking a site live on Pantheon, you'll likely need to add a new card to your account:

1. Click the **<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span> Add New Card** link.

1. Enter the email address you would like invoices sent to.

1. Enter your credit card information and click **Add Card**.

1. Make sure the desired card is selected and click **Continue**.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Select Existing Card" id="existing-cc-id">

To associate an existing card from your account as the payment method for this site:

1. Select the desired card.

1. Click **Continue**.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Send a Request" id="request-payment-id">

<Partial file="transfer-ownership-billing-intro.md" />
<Partial file="transfer-ownership-billing-steps.md" />

</Tab>

</TabList>

## Confirm Your Purchase

1. Make sure the **Plan** details are correct.

1. Verify the card shown in **Billing** details.

1. Click the **Submit** button.

The Site Owner will receive an email confirmation of this change, a new invoice will be issued, and a prorated amount for the current billing cycle will be credited or charged to the associated card automatically.

Invoices and transaction history related to this change can be found in **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Account** > **Billing**.

Add-ons
- [Pantheon Search](/solr) is a Solr-based system for indexing and searching site content. Pantheon provides Apache Solr v3.6 as a service for most plans including the Sandbox site plan.
 - [Object Cache](/object-cache) is a Redis-based open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store that can be used as a drop-in caching backend for your Drupal or WordPress website.

Pantheon also offers [New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring](/guides/new-relic) to our customers, built into the Site Dashboard. New Relic offers a wide array of metrics that provide a nearly real-time look into the performance of a web application.

## Enable Add-ons

From the Site Dashboard, click **Settings**, then click **Add Ons**. You will see all the available add-ons for your site.

You can access New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring directly from the Site Dashboard, by clicking on **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-eye-open"></span> New Relic**.

### Add-ons and the Basic Plan

Pantheon Search and Object Cache are available to Sandbox plans for testings, and to Performance Small plans and higher for production sites. If either feature is enabled on your site, the feature will stop functioning and may cause errors if the site is moved to a Basic plan.

For more information about the Basic plan, see [Manage Plans in the Site Dashboard](/site-plan/#basic-plan), or see our [Site Plan FAQ](/site-plans-faq#plan-resources) to learn more about plan resources.
