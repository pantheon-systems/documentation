All Partner Agencies and EDU organizations have Change Management and Custom Upstreams. Not all account levels qualify for Multidev, custom Vanity domains, email domains, or Single Sign-On (SSO). [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/contact-us) to find out how to add features to your organization.

### Multidev

Partner Agencies, Enterprise accounts, and [Gold Account](/guides/support/#support-features-and-response-times) EDU organizations and above have [Multidev](/guides/multidev) available with up to 10 active environments to use. All organization members with privileged roles have access to these environments. Team members of a site who are not members of the supporting organization will not have access to Multidev environments.

### Change Management

User roles at the organization level determine their level of access to sites supported or owned by the organization. [Learn more about change management](/change-management).

### Vanity Domains

Organizations can run site environments using their own custom Vanity domains, like `sites.myorganization.com`, instead of using `pantheonsite.io`. [Learn more about Vanity domains](/guides/domains/vanity-domains).

### Email-Based Registration

New users who sign up with the email address domain you specify will be automatically added to your organization.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO allows users to authenticate against your Identity Provider (IdP) when logging into the Pantheon Dashboard. [Learn more about SSO with SAML](/sso-organizations).

### Tagging

Sites in an organization can have one or multiple tags, to easily identify and/or group them. Tagging can be done from the Organization Sites dashboard or through [Terminus](/terminus):
