Workspaces are a home base for your WebOps.  There are two types of workspaces:

<dl>
    <dt>Personal Workspace</dt>
    <dd>The personal workspace displays tools for the sites to which you have access, your account tier, and billing for sites you own.  You have only one personal workspace.</dd>
    <dt>Professional Workspace</dt>
    <dd>Professional workspaces bring together users, sites, Custom Upstreams, Multidev, and support to provide administrators with the tools needed to effectively manage a large number of sites. You may be a part of no workspaces, or many workspaces, depending on your company setup.</dd>
