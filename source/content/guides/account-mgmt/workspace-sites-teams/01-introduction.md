Workspaces, Teams, and Sites work together to help you organize and manage your sites.  To understand how these three tools work together, lets look at a sample setup.

Our company, Writing Widgets, decides to set up three workspaces:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+

Within each workspace, they build their team.

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
| Site 1 | Site 2 | Site A | Site B | Site Z | Site Y |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Site 3 | Site 4 |        |        | Site X |        |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Jane Doe        | John Smith      | Jane Doe        |
| John Smith      | Andy White      | Dolores Orange  |
| Joe Intern      |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

... and create a bunch of sites...

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
| Jane Doe        | John Smith      | Jane Doe        |
| John Smith      | Andy White      | Dolores Orange  |
| Joe Intern      |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Site 1 | Site 2 | Site A | Site B | Site Z | Site Y |
+--------+--------+        |        +--------+--------+
| Site 3 | Site 4 |        |        | Site X          |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Finally, because sites in the Random workspace are so, well, random, they've also added a team member specifically to work on Site X.

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
| Jane Doe        | John Smith      | Jane Doe        |
| John Smith      | Andy White      | Dolores Orange  |
| Joe Intern      |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Site 1 | Site 2 | Site A | Site B | Site Z | Site Y |
+--------+--------+        |        +--------+--------+
| Site 3 | Site 4 |        |        | Site X | Site W |
+                 +--------+--------+--------+--------+
|                 |                 | Ed Kay |        +
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

So now, when the individual team members log on, they will see the sites and workspaces made available to them.  In our example, this is what they would see:

| Team Member | Workspaces | Sites |
|===|===|===|
| Jane Doe |Writing Sites, Random Sites|Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, Site 4, Site Z, Site Y, Site X, Site W|
| John Smith |Writing Sites, Widget Sites|Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, Site 4, Site A, Site B|
| Joe Intern |Writing Sites|Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, Site 4|
| Dolores Orange |Random Sites|Site Z, Site Y, Site X, Site W|
| Ed Kay |--|Site X|
