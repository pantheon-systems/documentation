Workspaces, Sites, and Teams work together to help you organize and manage your sites.  To understand how these three tools work together, lets look at a sample setup.

Our company, Writing Widgets, decides to set up three workspaces:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

Within each workspace, they build their team.

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
| Jane Doe        | John Smith      | Jane Doe        |
|                 |                 |                 |
| John Smith      | Andy White      | Dolores Orange  |
|                 |                 |                 |
| Joe Intern      |                 |                 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

... and create a bunch of sites...

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
| Jane Doe        | John Smith      | Jane Doe        |
|                 |                 |                 |
| John Smith      | Andy White      | Dolores Orange  |
|                 |                 |                 |
| Joe Intern      |                 |                 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Site 1 | Site 2 | Site A | Site B | Site Z | Site Y |
+--------+--------+        |        +--------+--------+
| Site 3 | Site 4 |        |        | Site X          |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Finally, because sites in the Random workspace are so, well, random, they've also added a team member specifically to work on Site X.

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Writing Sites   | Widget Sites    | Random Sites    |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
| Jane Doe        | John Smith      | Jane Doe        |
|                 |                 |                 |
| John Smith      | Andy White      | Dolores Orange  |
|                 |                 |                 |
| Joe Intern      |                 |                 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Site 1 | Site 2 | Site A | Site B | Site Z | Site Y |
+--------+--------+        |        +--------+--------+
| Site 3 | Site 4 |        |        | Site X          |
|        |        |        |        |                 |
|        |        |        |        | Ed Kay          |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

So now, when the individual team members log on, they will see the workspaces made available to them.  In our example, this is what they would see:

| Team Member | Workspaces |
|---|---|
| Jane Doe |Writing Sites, Random Sites|
| John Smith |Writing Sites, Widget Sites|
| Joe Intern |Writing Sites|
| Dolores Orange |Random Sites|
| Ed Kay |Random Sites|

When they select a workspace, they will then see the sites they have access to in that workspace, as well as any sites they have created.

Read on to better understand the specifics of setting up your workspaces, sites, and teams.
