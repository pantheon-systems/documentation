Learn how to view and manage your invoices and subscriptions.

## Invoices

To view your invoices:

1. [Go to your Personal Workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces#switch-between-workspaces), click **Settings**, then select **Invoices**.

Sites are listed below the card to which they are assigned. Up to 100 of the most recent invoices are shown in the list.

### Receiving Invoices via Email

Invoices are emailed to the email address associated with the payment method.  To change the email address, [update the payment method](/guides/account-mgmt/billing/methods#update-personal-payment-method).

### Invoice Details

The details in the invoice include:

|Invoice item| Description|
|------------|------------|
|Subscription Number / Site Name| The primary site name of your site in the workspace|
|Bill To| The address specified for the payment method|
|Product Detail| The account and associated usage or commitment renewal|
|Unit Price| Cost for subscription|
|Method| Credit card used|

You can download the invoice as a PDF or CSV file. You can also print the PDF or import the CSV into a spreadsheet program.

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

Only the Site Owner can download invoices.  If this site is a part of a contract organization, reach out to the organization for assistance.  Sites that are part of a contract organization show the organization as the User in Charge on the **Workspace** tab.

</Alert>

If your billing country is in the European Union (EU), your invoices may also include the value-added tax (VAT) ID.
These invoices comply with the EU requirements of the VAT Directive (Article 226, Council Directive 2006/112/EC) and are valid for your local tax authorities. 

### Sort Invoices


Invoices can be sorted by:

* Invoice date
* Invoice number
* Payment method
* Payment amount

You can also use the search bar to find a specific invoice. Enter keywords, methods, dates, or amounts in the search bar to yield results.

## Subscriptions

The Subscriptions page catalogs your access to sites in your Personal Workspace and the payment methods used.

Subscriptions can be sorted by the following information:

* Site name
* Site plan
* Billing cadence
* Cost
* Payment method

### Account Subscription

The account tier and cost is displayed on the Subscriptions page. You can also view updates to the Personal Workspace account tier. You cannot edit or manage account tiers within the workspace. 

### Site Subscriptions

By default, sites are listed by name. You can sort according to your preference. For more information on a site in your Personal Workspace, you can click the site name in the Site Subscriptions table or click the **Sites** tab. Additionally, you can filter sites by site plan or payment method.
