The permission to transfer ownership or update payment method is granted only to the role of **Site Owner**. You can see who is assigned the role of Site Owner by clicking **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Team** in the Site Dashboard or Professional Workspace. Other roles do not have access to billing as described on this page.

## Transfer Ownership

See [Change Site Ownership](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#change-site-ownership) for instructions.

## Accept an Invitation to Pay

You'll receive an email inviting you to pay for the site when a supporting organization is ready to transfer ownership of the site to you.

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

If you already have a Pantheon, log in to that account before you begin. If you're **not logged in**, you'll be prompted to create a new account.

</Alert>

1. In the email, click **Make Payment**.  

1. Select an existing card if one is on file, or add a new card to use as payment for the site.

You will receive invoices at the end of each billing cycle after you've accepted the invitation.
