Follow the steps below to completely delete your account.

## 1. Backup and Export

You should backup and export your site(s) before you delete your account. Even though you are leaving the platform, you should still have a backup of your work just in case you need it in the future.

Refer to [Create a Backup](/guides/backups/create-backups) if you need to make a backup of an existing environment.

Refer to [Restoring a Backup](/guides/environment-configuration/restore-environment-backup) for more information about exporting a backup of an environment.

## 2. Delete Each of Your Sites

Refer to [Deleting a Site](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#delete-sites) after you have backed-up your data and are ready to delete your sites. Site deletion is a simple one-click operation, but it is **_permanent_**. Don't worry; you will be prompted to confirm before the deletion occurs.

## 3. Delete Your Credit Cards

The next step is to delete the associated credit cards. Refer to [Payment Methods](/guides/account-mgmt/billing/methods) for more information.

## 4. Delete Your Account

1. [Go to your Personal Settings](/personal-settings), select **Profile**, and click the **Delete Account** button. 

1. Enter the verification text to confirm.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my site still accessible after it's been deleted?
Your site may still be accessible for a short period of time because the platform does not clear cache upon site deletion. To avoid this behavior, clear cache before deleting the site.

### Can I come back to the platform later?

Of course. That's why the first step in this process is to backup and export your site. To restore your site from a backup, refer to [Restoring a Backup](/guides/environment-configuration/restore-environment-backup).
