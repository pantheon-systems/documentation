Follow the steps below in to completely delete your account.

## 1. Backup and Export

The first thing to do is to backup and export your site(s). Yes, you are leaving the platform, but you should always have a backup of your work just in case you need it in the future.

If you need to make a backup of an existing environment, see [Create a Backup](/backups#create-a-backup).

For more information about exporting a backup of an environment, see [Restoring a Backup](/guides/environment-configuration/restore-environment-backup).

## 2. Delete Each of Your Sites

Once you have backed-up your data and are ready to delete your sites, see [Delete a Site](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#delete-sites). It is a simple one-click operation, but it is **_permanent_**. Don't worry; You will be prompted to confirm before the deletion occurs.

## 3. Delete Your Credit Cards

The next step is to delete the associated credit cards. For more information, see [Account Billing in the User Dashboard](/guides/legacy-dashboard/account-billing#delete-card).

## 4. Delete Your Account

Go to your **Personal Settings**, select **Profile**, and click the **Delete Account** button. Enter the verification text to confirm.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my site still accessible after it's been deleted?
Your site may still be accessible for a short period of time because the platform does not clear cache upon site deletion. To avoid this behavior, clear cache before deleting the site.

### Can I come back to the platform later?

Of course. That's why the first step in this process is to backup and export your site. To restore your site from a backup, see [Restoring a Backup](/guides/environment-configuration/restore-environment-backup).
