Pantheon offers a number of [ways to connect to your site](/guides/quickstart/connection-modes). In addition to Git and SFTP modes, [Pantheon Localdev](https://pantheon.io/localdev) gives macOS users a graphical interface to your Pantheon sites, complete with a containerized local environment that makes it easy to develop and preview your site locally while still maintaining the [Pantheon Workflow](/pantheon-workflow).

Localdev allows you [use an integrated development environment (**IDE**)](/guides/localdev/using-localdev#use-a-local-ide-to-develop-your-pantheon-site) to edit files, code, and push changes to Pantheon right from your desktop. Use it if you want to avoid the command line, or to develop sites with a fully functional local preview.

For users looking to be more hands on and willing to use the terminal, try [Terminus](/terminus) and [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/started.html). The [Local Development](/local-development) doc can help you get started.
