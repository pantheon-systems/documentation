This section provides answers to frequently asked New Relic&reg; questions.

### How do I change the New Relic&reg; site owner now that our Pantheon site has a new site owner?

A New Relic&reg; account can have only one owner at any given time. You must be the current account owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. For more information, see [New Relic&reg;'s documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/change-account-owner).

### How can I share a link to a particular metric?

Click **Permalink** at the bottom of any page. This will preserve the current time window and take the link recipient to the same page you are currently viewing.

### How much does New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring cost?

Pantheon provides New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring at no cost for all site plans except Basic. Purchase additional services or upgrade your New Relic&reg; account by reaching out to [sales@newrelic.com](mailto:sales@newrelic.com).

### Will turning on New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring slow my site down?

No, New Relic&reg; will not make your site slower. The overhead is small enough to be almost imperceptible. The amount of available metrics useful for debugging and improving performance far outweighs the negligible difference.

### What is the difference between app server response time and browser page load time?

App server response time measures how the page was built on Pantheon, including PHP execution, database, and Redis (if used). Browser page load time measures theÂ additional time of client-side page rendering, DOM processing, and how long it took to transfer to the client. While a fast app server response time is optimal, a slow browser page load time indicates a bad user experience. Likely causes include:

- Unaggregated or uncompressed scripts and stylesheets

- Invalid markup

- Unoptimized client-side code (like JavaScript)

### Can I use my existing New Relic&reg; license with my Pantheon site?

Yes. If you have a [Supported Site Plan](#supported-site-plans), you can bring your own New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring license. [Activate New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring](#activate-new-relic-performance-monitoring) for your site, then [contact support](/guides/support/contact-support/). Be sure to provide:

- Your Site ID

- Your New Relic&reg; [License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key#finding)

- Your New Relic&reg; [Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id#finding)

<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

Pantheon SSO cannot be used to sign in to New Relic&reg; for sites using their own license. You will not be able to sign in to New Relic directly from the Pantheon Dashboard.

</Alert>

### Why are servers listed in New Relic&reg; with no data?

Because Pantheon's runtime matrix runs your application across many containers simultaneously, it's common to see old containers with no reporting data as your application shifts around. This is not a cause for concern.

### Can I disable New Relic&reg; for a specific environment?

We don't recommend turning off New Relic&reg; for any one environment, as it makes troubleshooting errors and performance issues more difficult. However, you can [disable the New Relic&reg; Browser agent](/guides/new-relic/troubleshoot-new-relic#disable-new-relic-browser-monitoring-agent) if you encounter a situation where it is interfering with other systems, and you can also [write logic based on the environment](/guides/php/wp-config-php#environment-specific-configuration).

### Can I use the New Relic&reg; One Logs feature?

New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring logs are available at `/logs/newrelic.log`. The New Relic&reg; provided with your Pantheon account does not include the new **Logs** feature found in the **Events** section of New Relic&reg;'s left-side menu.

Refer to [Log Files on Pantheon](/guides/logs-pantheon) for more information on accessing your logs.

### Why do I get a permissions warning while trying to access some parts of New Relic?

Pantheon provides New Relic Performance Monitoring for sites on [supported plans](/guides/new-relic#supported-site-plans). Certain components of New Relic fall outside this offering. Please [contact support](/guides/support/contact-support/) if you cannot access a New Relic feature that you should have access to.

### Can I get New Relic&reg; Synthetics?

Yes, for details see [Monitor and Improve Site Performance](/guides/new-relic/monitor-new-relic/#configure-ping-monitors-synthetics-for-availability).
