This section provides steps on how to activate and configure your New Relic&reg; account.

## Activate New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring

New Relic&reg; is automatically enabled for all application containers added to the site, including Multidev environments. You can activate New Relic&reg; in the Site Dashboard if you or a team member previously disabled it.

## Configure New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring Access

1. Go to the <i className="fa fa-eye"></i> **New Relic** tab on your Site Dashboard, and click **Go to New Relic**.

1. Select your site from the center column, or access it via **APM & services** in the menu on the far left.

### Who is the New Relic&reg; account associated with?

- If the site owner is a **user**, the site owner's name and email address are used to create the New Relic&reg; account.

- If the site owner is an **organization**, the name and email address of the organization's Pantheon user who activates New Relic&reg; is used to create the New Relic&reg; account.

In both cases, there is not a one-to-one mapping between Pantheon users and New Relic&reg; users. Every Pantheon user who selects **Go to New Relic** from the Pantheon dashboard is logged in as the same New Relic&reg; user.

## Open New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring

Moving forward, to open New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring:

1. [Go to the Site Dashboard](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#site-dashboard) of the site you suspect is having problems with MySQL query performance.

1. Select the environment: Dev, Test, or Live.

1. Click the **New Relic** tab, and then select **Go to New Relic**.
