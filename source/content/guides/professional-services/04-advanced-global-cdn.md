[<dfn id="agcdn">Advanced Global CDN</dfn>](https://pantheon.io/product/advanced-global-cdn?docs) is a Managed Service that takes Pantheon's <abbr title="Content delivery network">CDN</abbr> offering a step forward, for customers that require unique optimizations for digital delivery at scale.

Each AGCDN service configuration is offered as an annual contract subscription. Customers can include multiple sites to the configuration, or conditionally apply specific rules.

It includes a wide range of benefits that let teams individually manage their own sites, drive growth through site iteration, calibrate control over branding, and extend enterprise-grade security.

## Features

### OSI Layer 3 & 4 DDoS Protection & Mitigation

Advanced Global CDN provides <abbr title="Distributed Denial of Service">DDoS</abbr> protection and mitigation at the network (Layer 3) and transport (Layer 4) layers of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).

### SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance

SOC 2<Popover title="SOC" content="System and Organization Controls (SOC) is a suite of audit reports defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)." /> Type 2 compliance provides third-party assurance to our customers about the conformance of Pantheon’s information security system with industry standards. Our SOC 2 compliance covers the Security and Availability [Trust Services Criteria](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/trustdataintegritytaskforce.html).

### IP Allowlisting & Blocklisting

 Granular access control down to the IP address level helps protect intellectual property and secure development environments.

- Blocklist - prevent users with specific IPs or in IP ranges from accessing your site.

- Allowlist - only allow users with specific IPs or in IP ranges to access your site, blocking everyone else.

### Token Authentication / JWT (JSON Web Token)

Use the AGCDN Edge to generate JSON Web Tokens<Popover title="JSON Web Tokens" content="A JSON Web Tokens is an Internet standard for creating compact, encrypted JSON-based access tokens that assert some number of claims, such as 'logged in as admin'." /> to help build your custom API.

### Custom Error & Maintenance Page Rules

Response code messages enable you to create custom error pages (e.g., 404 and 503 errors) for a tailored end-user experience.

### Geolocation-based Actions

Sending location info to your application is much faster than fetching it from a third-party API. AGCDN enables actions based on the physical location of your user (eg. blocking or redirecting based on country), and can send location information to your application for performant, custom control.

### Device Detection and Edge Control

[Device detection](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/delivering-different-content-to-different-devices) can drive differentiated delivery strategies at the edge of the network, to address issues that impact mobile user experience.

### Complete CDN Edge Logs

See every request to your website, whether or not the content was cached. Server logs can only record requests that couldn't be fulfilled from a CDN's cache. Full CDN edge logs replace these with logs from the edge, to provide a complete picture of your traffic.

### Modify and Filter Headers at the Edge

Change or filter request and response headers before your application starts up to create, add, delete, or update parts of your request and apply custom rules.

### Edge Redirects

Reduce requests to your CMS by moving page redirects to the edge. We can do path, domain, and pattern-based (RegEx) redirects, or redirects based on geolocation information. We can also combine redirect behavior using Headers (Cookies, Responses, etc).

### Domain Masking and Reverse Proxy

- Domain masking: run multiple Pantheon or non-Pantheon applications behind a single domain, using different URL paths.
- Reverse proxy: serve content from another service (eg. S3) seamlessly from your application.

### Enterprise Blue/Green Deployment Support

Support for blue/green deployment<Popover title="Blue/Green Deployment" content="With a blue/green deployment strategy, the new version of your application is released alongside the current version. After you conduct appropriate tests, traffic is switched to the new version." /> CI/CD processes that enable continuous testing and deployment workflows and always ready disaster recovery.

### Additional Features from WAF/IO

- Efficient <abbr title="Image Optimization">IO</abbr> at the edge

  With **Image Optimization (IO)** images render quickly from the edge offloading work from your servers and adding resilience to your site. IO supports a number of formats including animated GIFs.

- Layer 7/Enterprise WAF rules

 Application-layer (OSI Layer 7) protection simplifies event monitoring and mitigation without requiring changes that introduce latency.

- OWASP & WAF rules for Drupal/WordPress

  Support for <abbr title="Open Web Application Security Project">OWASP</abbr> WordPress and Drupal rules helps you monitor and address the most commonly seen application risks for these popular CMSes. Examples include SQL injection and <abbr title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr> vulnerabilities.

- Custom/Comprehensive WAF services

  Our Web Application Firewall (**WAF**) inspects each packet in detail to block malicious traffic and is fine-tuned for WordPress and Drupal.

- Advanced bot detection & mitigation (available as an add-on)

  The following third-party plugins are available:
  
  - [Shape Log Analysis](https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/How-to-Setup-Shape-Log-Analysis-in-Fastly?page=1)
  - [DataDome](https://docs.datadome.co/docs/module-fastly)
  - [PerimeterX](https://www.fastly.com/products/cloud-security/bot-detection)

  The customer is responsible for purchasing, maintaining payment for, and supporting these plugins.
