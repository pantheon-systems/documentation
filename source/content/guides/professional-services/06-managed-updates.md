[Managed Updates](https://pantheon.io/professional-services/managed-updates?docs) is a service offered by our [Professional Services](/guides/professional-services) team. We help keep your site updated so you can focus on what's important. Learn more about Managed Updates in the [Managing Updates for WordPress and Drupal webinar](https://pantheon.io/resources/managed-updates-webinar?docs)

With Pantheon Managed Updates (**PMU**), you get:

- CMS core updates
- Module / plugin updates
- Visual Regression Testing (**VRT**)

To make Managed Updates available to customers of all sizes and needs, Pantheon offers three versions: Premium, Lite, and Portfolio Upstreams.

### Premium

Managed Updates Premium is for standalone sites and includes support for custom workflows, testing, and CI/build processes. Premium also offers personalized update issue remediation, and email notifications when updates are scheduled. Sites using Pantheon's Integrated Composer for Drupal are also supported.

### Lite

Managed Updates Lite is for standard sites on Pantheon, and offers basic CMS and plugin updates (with visual regression testing) on a customizable schedule. It's for WordPress or Drupal sites that use the standard [Pantheon WebOps workflow](/pantheon-workflow), or Drupal sites using a Composer-build workflow without continuous integration processes.

### Portfolio Upstreams

Managed Updates for Portfolio Upstreams provides core, plugin, and module updates for customers managing site collections using [Custom Upstreams](/guides/custom-upstream).

#### Requirements

- Sites use Pantheon’s update workflow
  - Codebase changes are pushed to client's remote repo and then applied to each of the sites
  - Build step does not rely on 3rd-party sources
  - No other special deployment instructions
- Drupal 7 or WordPress 5.4 or above
