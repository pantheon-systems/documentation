The Enterprise Billing Center provides billing and site plan information for Enterprise (contract) customers. The Enterprise Billing Center allows you to:

- access, review, and download invoices

You must have Admin privileges to access the Enterprise Billing Center within the Pantheon dashboard. The Site Owner can change a user's privileges to Admin or download invoices and Site Portfolio Reports and share them if a team member cannot access the link or dashboard.
