Pantheon Secrets is key to maintaining industry best practices for secure builds and application implementation. This feature provides a convenient mechanism for you to manage your secrets and API keys directly on the Pantheon platform.
This guide covers features and use cases of the Pantheon Secrets feature; it could also be referred as Secrets Manager because that is the Terminus plugin name.
Features

* Secure: secrets are encrypted at rest.
* Easy to use: create and update secrets via Terminus.
* Governability: secrets could be set at organization level and shared to all the sites owned by that organization.
* Overridable: secrets could be overridden at environment level when needed.
  Support
