This section provides information on how to use DDEV for local development with Drupal sites on Pantheon.

## Before You Begin

Be sure that you have:

- An existing Drupal site on Pantheon, or [create](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create) a site.
- Reviewed the [Get started with DDEV guide](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Verified that you meet DDEV's [system requirements](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Installed Drush as part of your Drupal project. You can add this via your CLI:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    $ ddev composer require drush/drush
    ```

## Download and Install DDEV

1. Download the appropriate [DDEV release](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/ddev-installation/) for your Operating System.

1. Open the installer package and allow it to prepare.

1. Follow the system prompts to install DDEV.

## Use DDEV with Pantheon

1. Navigate to your Pantheon Dashboard and [generate a machine token](/machine-tokens/) for use with your DDEV site.

1. Open your global DDEV configuration file at `~/.ddev/global_config.yaml` and add the API token to the `web_environment` section:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    web_environment:
    - TERMINUS_MACHINE_TOKEN=insertyourtoken
    ```

1. Copy the `example.pantheon.yaml` provider file to the `pantheon.yaml`.

1. Update the project name and environment variable. In the example below, the project name is `de8` and the targeted environment is `live`. This example updates the local DDEV environment with database and content file backups from the Pantheon Live environment.

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    environment_variables:
    project: de8.live
    ```

1. Run `ddev pull pantheon` to update your local database and content files. You can add the `--skip-files` parameter if you don't want to sync the content files to your local. Remember to specify the site and Pantheon environment you want to target when running the `ddev pull` command, and create a new backup when you need to refresh what you pull.
