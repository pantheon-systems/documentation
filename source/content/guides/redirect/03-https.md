The standard best practice when using HTTPS is to set an [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) header to force connections over HTTPS only.

This configuration is recommended as part of the going live procedure. Configure these settings after connecting a custom domain in the Site Dashboard when you're ready to launch the site.

## Set HSTS with Pantheon.yml

This is the preferred method of setting HTTPS & HSTS for your site. 

1. Locate the `enforce_https` setting in your site's [pantheon.yml](/pantheon-yml) file.

1. Select one of the values in the table below to direct the `enforce_https` setting.
