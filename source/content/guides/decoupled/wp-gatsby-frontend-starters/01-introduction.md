Front-End Sites on Pantheon allow you to use [decoupled architecture](/guides/decoupled/overview/#what-is-a-decoupled-site) to separate your frontend and backend into distinct entities.

You can use a frontend starter kit to streamline the creation of your Front-End site on Pantheon. Available WordPress frontend starters are:

- Next.js + WordPress
- Gatsby + WordPress

## Why Use the Gatsby WordPress Starter?

The `gatsby-wordpress-starter` is designed as a starting point for a Gatsby
site that consumes data from a WordPress backend configured with the `pantheon-decoupled` and `wp-graphql` plugins installed.

The starter has a dependency on the `@pantheon-systems/wordpress-kit` that
includes helpers that maximize available WordPress backend features.

## Requirements and Considerations
