This section provides information on Settings. You can configure Front-End Site settings in the Pantheon dashboard, including:

- General Settings: Site Details, Connected Git repository, and site deletion
- Build and Output settings
- Site Environment Variables
- Build Hooks
- Deployment settings

## General Settings

You can change the Site Name, connect or disconnect your Git repository, and delete your Front-End Site in General Settings.

### Node.js Version

Pantheon respects the setting in `.nvmrc` when selecting the Node.js version for runtime. Currently supported versions are:

- Node.js 14
- Node.js 16
- Node.js 18

If you need to change the version of Node.js for your Front-End Site, you can test the new version by pushing the updated `.nvmrc` to a branch first.

### Change Site Name

1. Navigate to your **Site Dashboard**, click **Sites**, and then select the site you want to change the name of.

1. Click **Settings** or **General**.

1. Click the **Edit** button in the **Site Details** section.

1. Enter the new name and click **Save**.

### Connect or Disconnect a Git Repository

Note that a repository cannot be connected to more than one Front-End Site.
There are known issues around disconnecting and reconnecting a repository.

1. Navigate to your **Site Dashboard**, click **Sites**, and then select the site you want to connect or disconnect with your Git repository.

1. Click **Settings** or **General**.

1. Click the **Connect** or **Disconnect** button in the **Connected Git Repository** section. Confirm your selection when prompted if you are disconnecting your Git repository.

### Delete a Front-End Site

This feature only deletes your Front-End Site. Your CMS backend and connected Git repository are not affected. Visitors will not be able to access the site, and site team members will not be able to work on the site after deletion.

## Build Hooks

Build Hooks allow you to trigger a build automatically when you update the content in your CMS. You can use Build Hooks for your Front-End site if your CMS is hosted on Pantheon or hosted elsewhere.

Your Pantheon Front-End Site will rebuild and include your new content when a Build Hook is triggered. Each Build Hook you generate has a unique URL.

You can create and manage Build Hooks in the Pantheon Dashboard. You must
 [configure your Drupal backend](/guides/decoupled/drupal-backend-starters/build-hooks) or [WordPress backend](/guides/decoupled/wp-backend-starters/build-hooks) to use the Build Hooks you create in the Pantheon dashboard.

1. Click **Generate**. You will see the Build Hook listed under the Build Hooks section in the dashboard.

1. Click **Show URL** and then click **Copy** to copy your unique Build Hooks URL.

1. Optional. Copy the cURL code under **Test** if you want to test triggering a build with your hook.
