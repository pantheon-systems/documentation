Pantheon Front-End Sites Early Access (EA) program currently supports Gatsby and Next.js as frontend frameworks. Additional frameworks will be added to our official support list over the coming months.

You can use frontend frameworks other than Gatsby and Next.js. Note that while other frameworks are an option, we do not support all frameworks at this time. The process for non-officially supported frontend frameworks requires manual configuration.

## Before You Begin

- Know what type of framework you will use.

    - Is it a static or server-side rendering framework? This will matter when you are creating your site.

- Examine the build command for the framework you have chosen. Depending on the framework, you may need to adjust the files to build a Front-End Site successfully.

    - If the build command is `build`, you do not have to do anything for your build commands, although you may need to pay attention to the Output Directory as this may be different for the framework used.

    - If your framework uses a different command, you must adjust the build command on the Build Settings page. For example, if you have a static site framework that uses the command `npm run generate`, you must input `generate` as the build command.

- For sites that use server-side rendering, examine the `start` command for the framework you have chosen. Depending on the framework, you may need to adjust the files to run a Front-End Site successfully.

    - If the build command is `start`, you do not have to do anything for your build commands, although you may need to pay attention to the Output Directory as this may be different for the framework used.

    - If your framework uses a different command, you must update your `package.json` file to include an equivalent command called `start`. For example, if you use the command `npm run serve`, you must rename the command to `start` or create a duplicate start command.

    - If your `package.json` file does not include a `start` command, you must add it.
