This section provides information on how to use the Drupal + Next.js frontend starter kit.

## Before You Begin

The Pantheon `next-drupal-starter` uses Next.js and has been tested using [nodejs v16 with npm v8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before you continue.

- You are using a Git repository, and the repository is already connected.
- You are using Drupal as your CMS.
- You have installed and configured your Drupal site using the starter kit configuration.

1. Click the **Front-End Sites** tab and then click **+Create New Site**.
