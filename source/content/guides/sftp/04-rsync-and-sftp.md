This section provides information on how to use your SFTP client or rsync to transfer large files.

## File Size Limits

The Pantheon Filesystem supports files up to 256 MiB.  Attempting to write a file larger than that will fail.

- **Drupal:** `sites/default/files`
- **WordPress:** `wp-content/uploads`

An SFTP client or rsync allows you to transfer unlimited data server-to-server, which is faster than transferring from your workstation. Files can be transferred to and from any Pantheon site environment (Dev, Test, and Live).

<Alert title="Notes" type="info">

 - This section covers copying [files](/guides/filesystem), excluding database files. You cannot directly access the database files. Refer to [Use the Pantheon WebOps Workflow](/pantheon-workflow) for more information on how code moves up and content moves down.

 - You will not be able to use SFTP or rsync to add any file or directory listed in a `.gitignore` file to your Git repository. Any file uploaded in this way cannot be committed and will not be available for deployment.

</Alert>

There are two mechanisms for transferring files: SFTP and rsync.

## SFTP

There are a number of GUI SFTP clients available, such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). Do not use simultaneous connections.

1. [Go to the Site Dashboard](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#site-dashboard).

1. Click **Connection Info** to access your credentials. 

1. Connect to your SFTP client. The example belows uses a command-line SFTP client to connect to a site environment's file directory.

    <Alert title="Note" type="info">

    You must replace `[env]` with the target environment and `[uuid]` with the [Site UUID](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#retrieve-the-site-uuid) to connect. The values are case sensitive and must be lower case (for example, dev, test, live).

    </Alert>

    ```bash{outputLines: 2,4-5,7-9}
    export ENV=[env]
    # Usually dev, test, or live
    export SITE=[uuid]
    # Site UUID from dashboard URL: https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/[uuid]

    sftp -oPort=2222 $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in
    Connected to appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in
    sftp> cd files
    sftp> put [your file or files]
    ```

## rsync

rsync is an advanced tool that requires experience with the command line. You can also use the [Terminus rsync plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-rsync-plugin) as a shortcut to rsync files to your Pantheon sites. rsync is highly customizable. Refer to [rsync documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to learn more.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Your files must be in the `/files` directory for both Drupal and WordPress sites. This directory maps to `sites/default/files` for Drupal and `wp-content/uploads` for WordPress. Adjust paths as needed to include `web` (for example, `web/wp-content/uploads`) for [sites configured to use a nested docroot](/nested-docroot).

</Alert>

### Transfer Files with rsync

1. Ensure that source or the destination is a local file or directory. **The source and destination cannot both be remote.**

1. Replace `[env]` with the target environment and `[uuid]` with the [Site UUID](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#retrieve-the-site-uuid) before you run the code below to connect. The values are case sensitive and must be lower case (for example, dev, test, live).

    ```bash{outputLines:2,4-6,8-9,11-20}
    export ENV=[env]
    # Usually dev, test, or live
    export SITE=[uuid]
    # Site UUID from dashboard URL: https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/[uuid]

    # To Upload/Import
    rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' . --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/

    # To Download
    rsync -rvlz --copy-unsafe-links --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/ ~/files


        # -r: Recurse into subdirectories
        # -v: Verbose output
        # -l: copies symlinks as symlinks
        # -L: transforms symlinks into files.
        # -z: Compress during transfer
        # --copy-unsafe-links: transforms symlinks into files when the symlink target is outside of the tree being copied
        # Other rsync flags may or may not be supported
        # (-a, -p, -o, -g, -D, etc are not).
        ```

## Examples

<Alert title="Exports" type="export">

The examples below use the variables `$ENV` and `$SITE`. You must replace these variables with your site UUID and environment, or set them before you begin:

```bash{promptUser: user}
export ENV=dev
export SITE=3ef6264e-51d9-43b9-a60b-6cc22c3129308as83
```

Replace the example values above with the environment you're working with and your site UUID. You can find the UUID in your Site Dashboard URL:

https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/**3ef6264e-51d9-43b9-a60b-6cc22c3129308as83**

</Alert>

### Download a Drupal Directory from Pantheon

Download the contents of the `sites/default/files` directory into a folder on your local environment in the `files` home folder:

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/sites/default/files/ ~/files
```

### Download a WordPress Directory from Pantheon

Download the contents of the `wp-content/uploads` directory into a folder on your local environment in the `files` home folder:

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/wp-content/uploads ~/files
```

### Download a Drupal File from Pantheon

Download the `sites/default/settings.php` file into a Drupal installation called _Foo_ on your local environment in a  `sites/default/files` folder:

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/sites/default/settings.php ~/Foo/sites/default
```

### Download a WordPress File from Pantheon

Download the `index.php` file into a WordPress installation called _Foo_ on your local environment in a `wp-content/uploads` folder:

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/wp-content/uploads/index.php ~/Foo/sites/wp-content/uploads
```

### Upload a Directory to Pantheon

If you need to upload the file directory from a local installation called *Foo* in your home directory to a Pantheon site's Test environment `sites/default/files` directory, use the command below. If you are migrating a site or otherwise overwriting an existing site, remove `--ignore-existing` before running the command from the code example below.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

Always use the `temp-dir flag` when using rsync for uploads. Removing the flag will result in broken files after cloning from one environment to another.

</Alert>

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync --ignore-existing -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' ~/files/. --temp-dir=~/tmp/ 
$ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/
```

### Upload a Single File to Pantheon

This example shows how to upload the `logo.png` file into a Pantheon site's theme folder.

```bash{promptUser: user}
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' ~/Foo/sites/all/themes/foo/logo.png --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/sites/all/themes/foo
```

### Empty a Folder Recursively Using rsync

The `rm -r` command is not available over SFTP on Pantheon. An alternative way to recursively empty a folder is to use the rsync `--delete` flag. This example shows how to empty the remote folder `files/remote_folder_to_empty` (change this to match the remote directory you want to empty).

Create an empty folder with `mkdir empty_folder` on your local machine. The folder can be named anything, as long as it's empty.

```bash{outputLines:3}
export ENV=env # Replace with the site environment, usually dev, test, or live
export SITE=uuid # Replace with the site UUID, which you can find from the Site Dashboard URL or terminus site:info $sitename --field=id

rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -a --delete -e 'ssh -p 2222' empty_folder/ --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/remote_folder_to_empty
```

Now you can use `rmdir` over SFTP to remove the empty directory itself.

## Known Issues

Uploading a large number of files into a multi-container Live environment may fail silently. Follow the steps below if you're uploading many files, and your Live environment has [multiple application containers](/application-containers/#multiple-application-containers).

1. Upload to an environment other than Live (for example, Dev).

1. Use the clone operation in the Dashboard or [Terminus](/terminus/commands/local-clone) to move the files to Live.
