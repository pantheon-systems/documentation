This section provides information on editing an existing Custom Upstream.

## Change Custom Upstream Name or Description

Follow the steps below if you want to change the name or description of your Custom Upstream.

1. Access the **Organization Dashboard** from your Admin dashboard.

1. Click the **<span class="upstreams-regular"></span> Upstreams** tab.

1. Click **Settings** next to the existing upstream requiring an update.

1. Make desired changes > click **Submit**.

1. Update any sites with the upstream so they receive the new authentication.

## Change Custom Upstream Repository URL or Password

You cannot modify the repository details on an existing Custom Upstream. we recommend creating a new Custom Upstream if there is a new URL or password you need to use. You will need to switch each site to the new upstream individually with [Terminus](/terminus):

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus site:upstream:set my-site "My New Custom Upstream"
```

You must be a site owner to switch a site's upstream. You will need to merge changes as a one-click update after a site's upstream has been changed. Review [Example Usage](/terminus/examples/#switch-upstreams) for more details.

You can safely delete the old Custom Upstream after all sites have been updated to track the new Custom Upstream. Review [Delete a Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream/delete-custom-upstream) for more information.
