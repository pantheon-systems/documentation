Pantheon Custom Upstreams are a self-serve feature available to anyone with access to the [Organization Dashboard](/organizations) with an eligible plan. Organization members will be able to create new sites from a set common codebase after an Organization Administrator creates a Custom Upstream. The Custom Upstream must be created within each Organizationâ€™s Dashboard if you want to use a specific Custom Upstream for multiple Organizations. 

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Be aware that support for Custom Upstreams is limited to verification that the externally hosted upstream repository is connected to the platform correctly. For details, see [Get Support](/guides/support/#custom-upstreams).

</Alert>

## Create and Host the Repository Remotely

This remote repository serves as the central location for the development and maintenance of your Custom Upstream. Changes are tracked here and distributed downstream to sites within your Organization as one-click updates in the Site Dashboard.

Follow the steps for your preferred Git host below to create your repository.

   ![GitHub Initialization options](../../../images/github-avoid-readme.png)

  <Alert type="info" title="Note">

  As of October 1st, 2020, all new repositories on GitHub are initialized with the default branch name `main`.

  As a company, Pantheon is trying to use [more inclusive language in our repositories](https://pantheon.io/blog/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-pantheon?docs). While our team works to make Custom Upstreams less reliant on older naming conventions, new Custom Upstreams currently default to using the `master` branch name.

  Git's default naming convention differs from GitHub's. If you don't initialize the repository on GitHub, Git will assign the default branch name as `master` when you clone the repository locally.

  </Alert>

1. Click **Create Repository**.

1. Copy the repository URI (SSH) found in the **Quick setup** section:

  ![GitHub Repo URI](../../../images/github-repo-url.png)

  As of January 27th, 2021, all new repositories on Bitbucket are initialized with `main` as the default branch name.
 
  Pantheon intends to remove harmful language from our code and documentation. Please refer to our documentation on [more inclusive language in our      
  repositories](https://pantheon.io/blog/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-pantheon?docs) for more information. 

  As we strive to make Custom Upstreams less reliant on older naming conventions, new Custom Upstreams currently default to using the `master` branch name.

  Please note that Git's default naming convention differs from GitHub's. If you do not initialize the repository on Bitbucket, Git will assign the default branch name as `master` when you clone the repository locally.

</Tab>

</TabList>

## Pull in Core from Pantheon's Upstream

You must track Pantheon's corresponding upstream repository within the Custom Upstream to avoid incompatibilities.

1. Navigate to the Custom Upstream's root directory using the command line > add the appropriate Pantheon Upstream as a [remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote):

    <TabList>

    <Tab title="WordPress" id="wp1" active={true}>

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-wordpress https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Drupal 9" id="d91">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-drupal-9 https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title=" Drupal 7" id="d71">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-drops-7 https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    </TabList>

1. Run the appropriate command below now that the Custom Upstream repository is tracking the corresponding Pantheon core upstream.

    <TabList>

    <Tab title="WordPress" id="wp1" active={true}>

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git checkout -b master
    git fetch pantheon-wordpress
    git merge pantheon-wordpress/master
    git push origin master
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Drupal 9" id="d91">

    1. Pull and commit the core files:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     git checkout -b master
     git fetch pantheon-drupal-9 main
     git merge pantheon-drupal-9/main
     git push origin master
     ```

      - Drupal 9 on Pantheon includes [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) to manage dependencies. This adds a separate `composer.json` file in the `upstream-configuration` directory.

    1. Change to the `composer.json` file in the `upstream-configuration` directory  and use `composer require` to add packages to the Upstream > set the `config version` to a number that makes sense for you:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     cd upstream-configuration
     composer require drupal/pkg-name --no-update
     ```

       - Note that the optional `--no-update` flag in this command should only be used in Upstreams (as we do here) to instruct Composer not to check for updates now. See [How to Add Dependencies to Your Upstream](/guides/integrated-composer/ic-upstreams) for more information about adding dependencies.

    1. Commit and push the changes:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     git commit -am "added composer dependencies"
     git push origin master
     ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title=" Drupal 7" id="d71">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git checkout -b master
    git fetch pantheon-drops-7
    git merge pantheon-drops-7/master
    git push origin master
    ```

    </Tab>
