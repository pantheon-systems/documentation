This section provides information on how to use private paths to keep your files and code secure.

The Pantheon platform recognizes two distinct private directories for storing non-web accessible data.

Determining which path to use depends on whether or not the data should be tracked with Git as part of your site's codebase. For example, secret tokens or credentials for third-party services should not be version controlled alongside your site's code.

#### Private Path for Files (Not Version Controlled)

- Drupal: `sites/default/files/private`

- WordPress: `wp-content/uploads/private`

#### Private Path for Code (Version Controlled)

- Drupal and WordPress: `private`

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If you have not already created these directories, you will need to do that first. Create the folders in Dev via SFTP or Git, and push the changes to your Test and Live environments.

</Alert>

## Private Path for Code

Follow the steps below to store data that should be version controlled, such as [Quicksilver](/guides/quicksilver) scripts.

<TabList>

<Tab title="Git" id="git-example" active={true}>

1. Navigate to the `private` directory at the root level (the same level as `index.php`) of your cloned repository.

1. Upload your files within this directory.

   - The private path for code is the same for both Drupal and WordPress sites.

</Tab>

<Tab title="SFTP" id="sftp-example">

1. Navigate to the `code` directory.

1. Select the `private` directory at the root level (the same level as `index.php`) and upload your files.

   - The private path for code is the same for both Drupal and WordPress sites.

## Private Path for Files

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

The best solution to keep production keys secure is to use a key management service like [Pantheon Secrets](/guides/secrets) to automatically encrypt and secure keys.

</Alert>

Alternatively, you can store unencrypted keys in a JSON or ini-style text file within the following directories:

- WordPress: `wp-content/uploads/private`

- WordPress Multisite: `/wp-content/uploads/private/sites/<blog_id>/`

- Drupal: `sites/default/files/private`

These directories are symbolically linked to Valhalla and can also be accessed from the `files` directory when connecting via SFTP. This allows secure data to be distributed to other environments, while keeping it out of version control. You can then read the data from `settings.php` or `wp-config.php`, like so:

```php:title=settings.php%20or%20wp-config.php
if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT']) && $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] == 'live') {
  $json_text = file_get_contents('sites/default/files/private/stripe_live.json');
  $stripe_data = json_decode($json_text, TRUE);
  $conf['stripe_key'] = $stripe_data['key'];
}
else {
  // We aren't in prod, load a fallback or null key.
  $conf['stripe_key'] = 'foo';
}
```

The Drupal example above reads the key from the private file `stripe_live.json` only when the request is made from the Live environment on Pantheon.

### Plugins That Manage Private Paths

WordPress does not have a core feature to configure a private path folder for file uploads. There are several plugins on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) and projects on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/) that help protect direct access to files in the files area. However, these plugins commonly require an Apache HTTP server *.htaccess* (`mod_rewrite`) rule. Our NGINX servers [do not support *.htaccess* rules](/guides/platform-considerations/platform-site-info/#htaccess).

Site developers can author their own custom solution to:

- Provide authentication

- Access checks

- Use PHP's [readfile()](http://php.net/readfile/) or [fpassthru()](http://php.net/fpassthru/) functions to read files from:

  - WordPress: `wp-content/uploads/private`

  - Drupal: `sites/default/files/private`

- Output files to the authenticated web user's browser

### Known Limitations of File Names and Permissions

Please refer to [Pantheon Filesystem](/guides/filesystem) for more information.

### Additional Drupal Configuration

These files are web-accessible based on the access control rules that you set for your site and will use the following directory: `sites/default/files/private`

Follow the steps below to set up the configuration.

1. Navigate to **Administration** > **Configuration** > **Media** > **File System**.

1. Select **Private local files served by Drupal** as the default download method.

1. Click **Save Configuration**.

## Protected Web Paths

Another way to protect files and directories is to define a protected web path in your `pantheon.yml` file. See [Protected Web Paths](/pantheon-yml#protected-web-paths) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

### Resolving Warning: file_put_contents(private:///.htaccess)

If you receive a `file_put_contents(private:///.htaccess)` error, confirm that the private path for code or files exists in your repository.

If you are configuring a private path for code:

1. Start from your Dev environment and create the private directory.

1. Commit via Git, or create via SFTP and commit via Pantheon Dashboard.

1. Deploy to Test and Live to deploy the new directory after the directory has been created and committed.

1. Resubmit your changes via the file systems settings page in your Drupal Admin interface for each environment.

### Selectively Exposing Code

If you have a private code library that needs to have a specific sub-directory exposed (for example, using `SimpleSamlPHP`), you can do this with symlinks:

```bash
# from within a git checkout
ln -s private/simplesamlphp/public ./simplesaml
git add simplesaml
git commit simplesaml -m "adding simplesaml symlink"
git push origin master
```

The result will be a web-accessible URL at `https://dev.yoursite.pantheonsite.io/simplesaml` which will point to the code in `/private/simplesamlphp/public`.

### Setting Commerce Kickstart or Ubercart Key Path

Make sure to set a relative path for these keys. This ensures the key path will work on all appservers across the site's environments.

1. Set the encryption key path. You can either set the path in the Drupal admin interface, or with Terminus and Drush:

   ```bash
   terminus drush <site>.<env> -- vset uc_credit_encryption_path <my_private_path>
   ```

   `<my_private_path>` can be set to either of these non-web accessible private directories:

   - `'sites/default/files/private'` (preferred)
   - `'private'` (version controlled)

1. Create the private directory you have chosen and upload the key.

   - Optionally, verify that `uc_credit_encryption_path` is set correctly:

     ```bash
     terminus drush <site>.<env> -- vget uc_credit_encryption_path
     ```

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

We do not encourage developers to save credit card information on the platform, but we do realize that for development this may be useful if you need a test payment method.
