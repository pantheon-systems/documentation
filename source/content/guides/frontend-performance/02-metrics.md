There are many different ways to measure page speed and performance. This guide will help you tune your site for the metrics in Google's [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals), which focus on three aspects of the user experienceâ€”loading, interactivity, and visual stability.

These metrics include:

## Loading Performance

**LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** measures loading performance. Ideally, LCP should occur no more than 2.5 seconds after the page starts loading.

The amount of time it takes for a site to respond, **Time To First Byte** (TTFB), along with the time it takes a page to render meaningful content above the fold, **Time To First Paint** (TTFP), are both factors for Google's page rankings. All other qualifiers being equal, search rankings can drop by 5 or 10 if TTFB goes up a few hundred milliseconds.

## Interactivity Delay

**FID (First Input Delay)** measures how long it takes before interaction with the page is possible. A FID of less than 100 milliseconds provides optimal user experience.

## Visual Stability

**CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** measures visual stability, and helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. Pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1.

To tune your site for these metrics, focus on these key areas:

- [Reduce Server Response Time](/guides/frontend-performance/caching)
- [Compress Images](/guides/frontend-performance/media#compress-images)
- [Deliver Efficient CSS and JavaScript](/guides/frontend-performance/code-css#deliver-efficient-css-and-javascript)
- [Avoid Redirects](/guides/redirect)
