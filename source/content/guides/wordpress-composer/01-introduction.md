[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a widely-used PHP dependency and package manager that provides a simplified method to manage the external (non-core) code used by a WordPress site.

At the most basic level, Composer requires:

- A list of dependencies
- A place to put the dependencies

There are different cases for using Composer to manage dependencies on a WordPress site, including:

- Manage dependencies for themes and plugins youâ€™re currently developing

- Manage the themes and plugins currently used on the site

- Total site dependency management, including custom code


## First Steps

Complete the steps below before using this guide to create or manage updates on your Pantheon Composer-managed WordPress site.
