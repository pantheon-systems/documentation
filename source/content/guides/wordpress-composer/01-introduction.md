[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a widely-used PHP dependency and package manager that provides a simplified method to manage packages (plugins, themes and -- with the [WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream](/wordpress-composer-managed), WordPress core itself) used by a WordPress site.

At the most basic level, Composer requires:

- A list of dependencies
- A place to put the dependencies

There are different cases for using Composer to manage dependencies on a WordPress site, including:

- Manage dependencies for themes and plugins youâ€™re currently developing
- Manage the themes and plugins currently used on the site
- Manage WordPress core updates
- Total site dependency management, including custom code

## First Steps

Review the steps below before using this guide to create or manage updates on your Pantheon Composer-managed WordPress site.
