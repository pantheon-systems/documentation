This section provides information on how to configure your WordPress (Composer Managed) site on Pantheon for WordPress multisite. This guide assumes that you have already set up a [WordPress Multisite upstream](/guides/multisite/#request-a-wordpress-multisite) and created a new site using that upstream. If you haven't already, you should also read through our [guide on WordPress Multisite](/guides/multisite) before beginning this process.

Because Bedrock uses `Config::define()` and `config/application.php` instead of traditional `define()` statements in `wp-config.php`, you will not be able to use WP-CLI via Terminus to enable multisite as documented in our standard [multisite configuration guide](/guides/multisite/config/).

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Adjust placeholders in code snippets as needed throughout this guide. This includes placeholders such as `<site>` and `<env>` in Terminus commands, in addition to placeholders in brackets `<>` in larger code blocks.

</Alert>

## Set Up WordPress Multisite

1. Set the site's connection mode to Git:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    terminus connection:set <site>.dev git
    ```
2. Open the `config/application.php` file in your site's codebase and add the following line anywhere _above_ the `Config::apply();` line:

	```php
	Config::define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );
	```
3. Visit your development site's WordPress admin and navigate to **Tools** > **Network Setup**.

4. Choose **Sub-domains** or **Sub-directories** (depending on your needs), fill in the Network Title and Admin Email, and click **Install**.
5. You will be given instructions to update your `config/application.php` file. Below where you added the `WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE` line, copy and paste the code provided. The `SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL` value will be `true` or `false` depending on the option you chose in the previous step. For example, if you chose subdirectories, your `config/application.php` file should look like this:

	```php
	Config::define( 'MULTISITE', true );
	Config::define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false );
	// Use PANTHEON_HOSTNAME if in a Pantheon environment, otherwise use HTTP_HOST.
	Config::define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', defined( 'PANTHEON_HOSTNAME' ) ? PANTHEON_HOSTNAME : $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] );
	Config::define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );
	Config::define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
	Config::define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
	```
6. Save your changes and commit them to your Git repository. WordPress will prompt you to log back in after you push the changes.
7. Log into your site. When you log back into your WordPress admin dashboard, you will see a new **My Sites** menu item in the top left corner. This is where you can manage your network of sites. You now have a WordPress subdirectory multisite network set up on a WordPress (Composer Managed)-based upstream.

## Using Subdomain Multisite on Pantheon

Pantheon does not support sub-subdomains on the `pantheonsite.io` platform domain. This means that sub-sites on a subdomain multisite will not be accessible by default. See the [Mapping Custom Hostnames](/guides/multisite/config/#map-custom-hostnames-subdomain-configurations-only) panel in the Multisite Configuration guide for how to set up a custom domain for your sub-sites.

## Multisite Search and Replace with WordPress (Composer Managed)
Currently, the built-in dashboard [WordPress Multisite Search and Replace](/guides/multisite/search-replace/) does not support Composer-based WordPress multisites. To perform a search and replace on a WordPress (Composer Managed) multisite, you will need to use WP-CLI via Terminus manually. For more information, see our [WordPress Multisite Search and Replace](guides/multisite/workflows/#run-wp-cli-search-replace-manually) guide.
