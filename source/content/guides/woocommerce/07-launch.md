In order to launch your store and add a custom domain you'll need a paid [Pantheon Plan](/site-plan). Once you have upgraded to a paid Pantheon plan you can follow these instructions to [point your DNS and launch](/guides/launch).

Once you're on a paid plan don't forget to [enable automatic backups](/guides/launch/launch-check).

Now that your store is really live you can start marketing and prepare for the incoming orders!
