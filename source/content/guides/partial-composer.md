In this guide, you'll learn how to use Composer in small doses with WordPress and Drupal 7 so you can work towards best practices achieved by more advanced implementations. This allows you to continue using Pantheon's one-click core updates in the Site Dashboard while managing non-core dependencies with Composer.

## Before You Begin
- Read [Composer Fundamentals and Workflows](/docs/composer/)
- Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) locally
- Create a WordPress or Drupal 7 site on Pantheon

  
`markdown:/notes/partial-composer-adoption-warning.md`


- Set the site's connection mode to Git within the Site Dashboard or via [Terminus](/docs/terminus):

  ```bash
  terminus connection:set <site>.<env> git
  ```

- Create a local clone of your site code, and navigate to it in your terminal


## Initialize and Configure Composer
Use the `init` command to create a `composer.json` file that includes the appropriate package repository, then configure installation paths for dependencies like plugins and modules:

<TabList>

<Tab title="WordPress" id="wp-init" active={true}>

1. If you haven't done so already, [clone your Pantheon site repository](/docs/git/#clone-your-site-codebase) and navigate to the project's root directory. Replace `<site_name>` with your site's name (e.g., `your-awesome-site`):

      ```bash
      SITE=<site_name>
      `terminus connection:info $SITE.dev --fields='Git Command' --format=string`
      cd $SITE
      ```
2. Initialize composer to create a `composer.json` file with the WordPress package repository:

     ```bash
     composer init --repository=https://wpackagist.org --no-interaction
     ```
3. Edit the `composer.json` to add extra configuration that specifies installation paths for WordPress plugins and themes.

    <Alert title="Note" type="info">

    Since Pantheon does not support Git submodules <a class="pop" rel="popover" data-proofer-ignore data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" data-title="Git submodules" data-content="Some Composer packages are added as Git submodules, which place a Git repository within a subdirectory of your siteâ€™s repository."><em class="fa fa-info-circle"></em></a>, we recommend using the provided script `remove-git-submodules` to remove any `.git` directories upon install and update.

    </Alert>

    ```json
    {
      "repositories": [
        {
          "type": "composer",
          "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
        }
      ],
      "require": {},
      "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
          "wp-content/plugins/{$name}/": ["type:wordpress-plugin"],
          "wp-content/themes/{$name}/": ["type:wordpress-theme"]
        }
      },
      "scripts": {
        "remove-git-submodules": "find . -mindepth 2 -type d -name .git | xargs rm -rf",
        "post-install-cmd": [
          "@remove-git-submodules"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
          "@remove-git-submodules"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

4. Commit the `composer.json` file to version control with Git:

     ```bash
     git add composer.json
     ```

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Create composer.json with WP repo and install paths"
     ```

5. Push your new file to Pantheon:

     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```

<Tab title="Drupal 7" id="d7-init">

1. If you haven't done so already, [clone your Pantheon site repository](/docs/git/#clone-your-site-codebase) and navigate to the project's root directory. Replace `<site_name>` with your site's name (e.g., `your-awesome-site`):

    ```bash
    SITE=<site_name>
    `terminus connection:info $SITE.dev --fields='Git Command' --format=string`
    cd $SITE
    ```
`markdown:d7-composer-init.md`
4. Commit the `composer.json` file to version control with Git:

    ```bash
    git add composer.json
    ```

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Create composer.json with D7 repo and install paths"
    ```
5. Push your new file to Pantheon:

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

</Tab>

</TabList>

Anything you aren't managing with Composer is installed and maintained using the standard techniques such as using the WordPress or Drupal admin interfaces. Continue applying one-click core updates from Pantheon in the Site Dashboard.

## Require Dependencies
Use the `require` command to add new dependencies to your project, such as libraries or themes. This command modifies your `composer.json` file by including the specified dependency and it's compatible version.

<Tab title="WordPress" id="wp-require-papc-id" active={true}>

  #### Install a Plugin
  1. Require the plugin, [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/) for example, with Composer:

    ```bash
    composer require wpackagist-plugin/pantheon-advanced-page-cache
    ```
  2. Review modified files using `git status`, you should see the module has been installed in the `wp-content/plugins` directory like so:

    ![Require wpackagist-plugin/pantheon-advanced-page-cache output](../../docs/assets/images/guides/partial-composer/require-papc-plugin.png)

    Notice a missing dependency was also installed, `composer/installers`. This is package is needed to support the installation paths configured in the previous section.

    If you don't want to track the `vendor` directory with Git, add it to your site's `.gitignore` file before continuing.
  3. Commit your work to version control with Git:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Require pantheon-advanced-page-cache ^0.3.0 "
    ```
  4. Push your changes to Pantheon:

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```
  5. Navigate to the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench"></span> Dev** environment of the Site Dashboard.
  6. Click the **Site Admin <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt"></span>** button and login.
  7. Navigate to **Plugins** and activate Pantheon Advanced Page Cache.

</Tab>

  #### Install Site Local Drush
  The following example shows you how to install a site local Drush. You can use this method to require contrb modules, themes, and libraries.

  1. First, require the `composer/installers` package to support the installation paths configured in the previous section:

    ```bash
    composer require composer/installers
    ```
  2. Require Drush with Composer:

    ```bash
    composer require drush/drush
    ```
  3. Review modified files using `git status`:

    ![Require drupal/pantheon_advanced_page_cache output](../../docs/assets/images/guides/partial-composer/require-drush.png)

    If you don't want to track the `vendor` directory with Git, add it to your site's `.gitignore` file before continuing.
  4. Commit your work to version control with Git:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Require drush and composer/installers"
    ```
  5. Push your changes to Pantheon:

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

## Next Steps
If your use case doesn't require the more advanced Build Tools method, continue using Composer to manage any number of your non-core dependencies while preserving Pantheon's one-click core updates. This is only supported for Drupal 7 and WordPress. This is not supported on Drupal 8 as it will break one-click updates due to excessive conflicts.

If you're ready to learn best practices for Composer on Pantheon, follow the [Build Tools](/docs/guides/build-tools/) guide.
