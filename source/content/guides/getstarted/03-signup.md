1. Select whether you'd like to sign up with Google or with your email.

1. If Google, follow the steps that your Google account requires for sign up.

  If email, enter your email address and a password, then click **Sign up with email**. Then check your inbox to verify your email address. From there you will be taken back to the login form where you can now enter your credentials to sign in.
  
  After you login, you will be asked to enter some registration details: First name, Last name, Country, and Terms of Service acceptance.
