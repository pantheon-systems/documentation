And now it's time to finally make your site available to the public! This section provides the minimum requirements to launch your site. Refer to our [Launch Guide](/guides/launch/) for more detailed information.

## Test Your Site

<Partial file="test-initialize.md" />

You have successfully finished adding a site in its Test environment.  Click **Visit Test Site** to view your site.

## Deploy Your Site to Live

After you [purchase a plan](/guides/getstarted/purchase), you can deploy your site live.  But first, you have to create the Live environment.

<Partial file="live-initialize.md" />

You have successfully finished adding a site in its Live environment.  Click **Visit Live Site** to view your site.

## Domain Configuration

At this point, you have a live site with a Pantheon URL, like `http://my-site.pantheonsite.io/`. To change that to a more friendly URL, you'll need to purchase a domain from a DNS provider.

After you've done that, connect your DNS:

1. Go to the **<Icon icon="wavePulse" /> Live** environment in your Pantheon Site Dashboard.

1. Select the **<Icon icon="global" /> Domains / HTTPS** tab.

1. Enter the `www` domain (for example, `www.example.com`), then click **Connect Domain**.

1. Verify ownership by adding a new DNS TXT value or by uploading a file to a specific URL. Select the method you prefer, and follow the instructions. Note that the values are randomized for security.

1. Click **Verify Ownership** to confirm. It can take 30 minutes or more for DNS records to propagate, depending on your DNS host and your domain's TTL values.

1. Open a new tab or browser window, and copy the **Required Values** to your [DNS](/guides/domains/dns) provider. If you see a message like "Waiting for HTTPS, DNS records will be provided when HTTPS provisioning completes.", wait one minute, then refresh the page.

1. Click **<Icon icon="arrowLeft" /> Back to Domains/HTTPS**.

1. Select **Connect Domain** and enter the bare domain (for example, `example.com`, and then click **Connect Domain**.

Then, configure your DNS:

1. Select **Details** next to the `www` domain.

1. Log in to the DNS host for the domain in a separate window.

1. Copy the value provided in the Pantheon Site Dashboard for the required **A** record, then use it to create an **A** record wherever you manage DNS. Repeat this step for <i>both</i> of the AAAA records.

1. Return to the **<Icon icon="global" /> Domains / HTTPS** page in the Pantheon Site Dashboard.

1. Click **Details** next to the bare domain.

1. Copy the value provided in the Pantheon Site Dashboard for the required **A** record, then use it to create an A record wherever you manage DNS. Repeat this step for <i>both</i> of the AAAA records.

Click below for detailed instructions for your specific DNS host.

You can run diagnostics at [Let's Debug](https://letsdebug.net/) if you are having difficulties issuing a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate. This tool can identify an array of issues specifically for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates, including problems with DNS, nameservers, networking issues, common website misconfigurations, and CA policy issues.

Your site is now live at the domain you have purchased!
