- An idea of what [workspaces](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces) you will need.
- Email addresses for team members you want to invite.
- Either the URLs of any sites you want to migrate, or the information to create a new site (site name, content managment system to use, etc.).
- Optional: payment method information.
