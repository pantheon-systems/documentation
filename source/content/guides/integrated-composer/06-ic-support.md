This section provides information on support for Integrated Composer.

## Pantheon Supports Composer 2

The version of Composer on the platform is Composer 2.

Some packages are not compatible with Composer 2. If you encounter a build error that instructs you to contact [Support](/guides/support/contact-support), validate the package version's compatibility locally first, and check Drupal's [Preparing your site for Composer 2](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/preparing-your-site-for-composer-2#s-composer-plugins) documentation for packages that have already been identified.
