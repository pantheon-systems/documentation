This section provides information on how to use an Upstream with Integrated Composer, including steps to add dependencies to your Upstream.


## Upstreams

An Upstream refers to the source code in Git that shares a Git history with "downstream" individual sites made from it. Upstreams includes the core code for [Drupal](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed), [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/wordpress-project), and some customizations for the Pantheon platform.
