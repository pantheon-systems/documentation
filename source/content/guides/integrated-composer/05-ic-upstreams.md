This section provides information on how to use Upstream with Integrated Composer, including steps to add dependencies to your Upstream.

## Upstream

Upstream refers to the source code that is hosted in the Pantheon code repository and includes the core code for [Drupal](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed), [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/wordpress-project), and some customizations for the Pantheon platform.

### How to Add Dependencies to Your Upstream

1. [Clone the Git repository](/guides/git/git-config#clone-your-site-codebase) from the Site Dashboard.

1. Change into the Upstream's configuration directory:

   - Drupal:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    cd upstream-configuration
    ```

   - WordPress:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    cd upstream-config 
    ```

1. Run the `composer require` command for each dependency:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    composer require drupal/pkg-name --no-update
    ```

     - `--no-update` tells Composer to disable automatic updates of the dependency. This makes Composer faster when adding dependencies to the Upstream as shown here.
     - `--no-update` should not be included when adding dependencies to a site.

1. _Optional_ . Set or increment the current configuration version. This step can be skipped initially. Only perform this step if you are prompted to update the Composer config version.

     - Confirm the version:

        ```bash{outputLines:2}
        composer config version
        ```

     - Increment the config version number when you update dependencies. If you don't increment the version number, Composer will ignore updated dependencies.
     - Replace `1.0.1` in this example with the latest version number:

       ```bash{promptUser: user}
       composer config version 1.0.1
       ```

1. Commit and push your changes.
