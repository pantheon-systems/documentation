This section provides information on Pantheon's WordPress plugin.

Pantheon maintains an [optimized version of WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress) that includes a plugin to control cache expiration. By default, pages expire from the Varnish Edge Cache after 1 week. The plugin sets a default HTTP header: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800`

## Clear Site Cache

You can clear the site cache manually or automatically.

- To clear the cache manually, click the **Clear Cache** button.

- To clear the cache automatically, refer to the [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache) and follow the instructions.

## Pantheon Page Cache Plugin Configuration

### Increase the Default Time to Live Value

You can increase the default time to live value to improve the chances that a visitor will request a cached page. Cached page requests reduce page load times.

1. Log in to your WordPress site as an administrator.

1. Click **Settings**.

1. Click **Pantheon Cache**. You'll end up at: `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pantheon-cache`

1. Modify the **Default Cache Time**.

    When [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-advanced-page-cache) is active, your site content should always be fresh and served quickly from Pantheon's Edge Cache. This is why we recommend caching content for a minimum of 1 week. Every page served from the Edge Cache won't hit your application container's PHP workers or MySQL database, which means faster page load times and a better user experience for site visitors.

1. Click **Save Changes**.

### Override the default max age

Since the [1.4.0 update in the Pantheon MU Plugin](/release-notes/2024/04/pantheon-mu-plugin-1-4-0-update), you can override the default `max-age` using a filter. This is useful if you want to set a different max age for specific pages or post types, or if you want to set it to a specific value programmatically.

```php
add_filter( 'pantheon_cache_default_max_age', function() {
    return 2 * WEEK_IN_SECONDS;
} );
```

### Maintenance Mode

You can enable maintenance mode for others while working on your site.

1. Log in to your WordPress site as an administrator.

1. Click **Settings**.

1. Click **Pantheon Cache**. You'll end up at: `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pantheon-cache`

1. Modify the **Maintenance Mode**.

    A simple notice displays to users who request a page that is not already cached.
    `Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.`

1. Click **Save Changes**.

## Use Pantheon Cache Functions Programmatically

There are functions that are useful to developers within the [Pantheon MU plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-mu-plugin/blob/main/inc/pantheon-page-cache.php). You can call them from within your own custom code using various WordPress hooks, such as [`save_post`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/save_post/).

### flush_site

This function flushes the site cache for the entire site. This achieves the same result as the **Clear Site Cache** button on the Pantheon Cache administration page.

```php
/**
 * Clear the cache for the entire site.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function flush_site()
```

### clean_post_cache

This function flushes the cache for an individual post, which is identified by the `$post_id`. The optional `$include_homepage` argument can also be passed. The default value is `true` if no value is set.

```php
/**
 * Clear the cache for a post.
 *
 * @param  int $post_id A post ID to clean.
 * @return void
 */
public function clean_post_cache( $post_id, $include_homepage = true )
```

### clean_term_cache

This function flushes the cache for an individual term or terms which are passed in an array, or for a complete taxonomy passed via a single taxonomy ID.

```php
/**
 * Clear the cache for a given term or terms and taxonomy.
 *
 * @param int|array $ids Single or list of Term IDs.
 * @param string $taxonomy Can be empty and will assume tt_ids, else will use for context.
 * @return void
 */
public function clean_term_cache( $term_ids, $taxonomy )
```

Additional filters are added and available only when the [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/tree/e3b5552b0cb9268d9b696cb200af56cc044920d9?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-custom-keys) plugin is installed and active.

## Automatically Clear Cache on Archive Pages for Specific Custom Post Type

By default, adding a post, page or custom post type, clears the cache for the homepage and associated terms or categories associated with it. To clear cache for a specific page when a specific custom post type is added:

```php
add_action( 'save_post', 'custom_clearcache_archive_page' );
/**
 * Clear cache on a specific page when a specific custom post type is added or modified.
 *
 * @param int $post_id
 * @return void
 */
function custom_clearcache_archive_page( $post_id ){
	if ( get_post_type() === 'book' ) {
		pantheon_clear_edge_paths( ['/books-on-startups-entrepreneurship-and-venture-capital/'] );
	}

	if( get_post_type() === 'public-media' ) {
		pantheon_clear_edge_paths( ['/archives/media/'] );
	}
}
```

The `pantheon_clear_edge_paths` function is declared in the PHP runtime and is only available on the Pantheon platform.
