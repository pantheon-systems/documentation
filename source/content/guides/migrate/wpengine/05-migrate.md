Pantheon provides a wpengine path for migrating existing sites to the platform, which begins by clicking the **Migrate Existing Site** button on the User Dashboard.

<Partial file="migrate/migrate-wordpress.md" />

If the migration is not successful, review [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting), or [contact Support](/guides/support/contact-support/) and include a link to the Site Dashboard and any details you can provide, such as where you are migrating the site from.
