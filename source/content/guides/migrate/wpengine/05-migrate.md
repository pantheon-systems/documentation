Pantheon provides a WP Engine path for migrating existing sites to the platform. This process begins by clicking the **Migrate Existing Site** button on the User Dashboard.

<Partial file="migrate/migrate-wp.md" />

Review [Troubleshooting](/guides/wpengine/troubleshooting) or [contact Support](/guides/support/contact-support/) if the migration is unsuccessful. Include a link to the Site Dashboard and any details you can provide, such as where you are migrating the site from.
