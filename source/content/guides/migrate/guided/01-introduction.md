Welcome to Pantheon! We want to make it easy for you to move a site from another hosting provider to Pantheon. Use the following instructions and you'll be good to go!

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

If you're coming from any of the following providers, we have customized instructions for you:

- [Acquia](/guides/acquia/migrate)
- [Kinsta](/guides/kinsta/migrate)
- [Pagely](/guides/pagely/migrate)
- [Platform.sh](/guides/platformsh/migrate)
- [WordPress VIP](/guides/wordpressvip/migrate)
- [WP Engine](/guides/wpengine/migrate)

</Alert>

The overall process will only take a few minutes to go through our guided migration wizard, but it can take up to two hours for Pantheon to migrate your site. You will receive an email when the process is complete.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger" >
