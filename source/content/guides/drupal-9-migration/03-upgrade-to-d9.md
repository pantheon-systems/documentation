This doc shows how to upgrade an existing Pantheon-hosted Drupal 8 site without Composer to a Drupal 9 site with Integrated Composer.

Drupal 9 sites on Pantheon have Composer built-in to manage site dependencies.

The goals of this upgrade are to:

- remove dependencies that Composer will manage from the existing site's Git repository, and

- have Composer manage those dependencies in the new site instead.

Note that since you are effectively migrating your site using these upgrade steps, the new site will not maintain your site's existing commit history.

<Alert title="Multidev Required" type="danger">

To maintain best practice and to avoid difficult, time-consuming repairs to the site, this doc is written for users with access to Pantheon's [Multidev](/multidev) feature.

Pantheon support is not available to users who avoid the Multidev steps.
