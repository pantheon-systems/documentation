This page shows how to upgrade an existing Pantheon-hosted Drupal 8 site without Composer, to a Drupal 9 site with Integrated Composer, using a **Multidev** to stage changes, and then replace the `master` branch.

## Overview

The goals of this upgrade is to set the Drupal core dependency to Drupal 9. This upgrade allows Composer to manage dependencies in the new site.

Note that this upgrade migrates your existing site to a new site. The new site will not maintain your site's existing commit history.

## Will This Guide Work for Your Site?

<Alert title="Multidev Required" type="danger">

To maintain best practice and to avoid difficult, time-consuming repairs to the site, this doc is written for users with access to Pantheon's [Multidev](/multidev) feature.

Pantheon support is not available to users who avoid the Multidev steps.

## Ensure Dependencies are Drupal 9 Compatible

Before changing the Drupal core version to Drupal 9, make sure all the components of your site are Drupal 9 compatible. Review the steps in drupal.org's [Upgrading a Drupal 8 site to Drupal 9](https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/upgrading-a-drupal-8-site) for details, and use [Upgrade Status](https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status) to check the compatibility of all contributed modules and themes.

## Set Drupal Core Version

Set the Drupal core version to Drupal 9:

  ```shell{promptUser: user}
  composer require --update-with-dependencies --no-update 'drupal/core-recommended:^9' 'drupal/core-composer-scaffold^9'
  composer update drupal/core* -W
  git add composer.*
  git commit -m "upgrade to Drupal 9"
  ```

If you receive the error message "Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages", use the command `composer update` instead of `composer update drupal/core* -W`.

## Ongoing Core Updates

One-click core updates can be made through the Dashboard.

Navigate to **Code** in the Dev tab of the site's Dashboard. Click **Check Now**. If updates are available, click **Apply Updates**.
