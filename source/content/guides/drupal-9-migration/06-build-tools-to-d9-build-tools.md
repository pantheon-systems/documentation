This doc shows how to upgrade a Drupal 8 site that uses [Build Tools](/guides/build-tools) to a Drupal 9 site that continues to use the Build Tools workflow.

<Alert title="About Build Tools" type="info" icon="info-sign">

Build Tools connects Pantheon with your CI service and external Git provider. See the [Build Tools Guide](/guides/build-tools#a-build-tools-projects-components) for details on supported Git and CI services combinations.

</Alert>

## Will This Guide Work for Your Build Tools Workflow?

Before you continue, confirm that your site meets the following criteria:

1. Code is managed using an external repository outside of Pantheon (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

1. The site is built through a service like Circle CI.

1. Build artifacts are pushed to your Pantheon repository.

## Prepare the Local Environment

<Partial file="drupal-9/prepare-local-environment.md" />

Install the [jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq) JSON processor and [rsync](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rsync) on your local environment if they aren't already installed. On MacOS with Homebrew, run:

```bash{promptUser: user}
brew install jq rsync
```

## Prepare a Local Copy of the Site for Upgrade

1. In the **Dev** tab of the site's Dashboard, set the **Development Mode** to **Git**, and [clone the site locally](/local-development#get-the-code).

1. Change into the `$SITE` directory, then create a new branch based on the default:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   cd $SITE
   git checkout -b d9-upg-21
   ```

1. Use Terminus and Drush to export the latest version of the config files from the production environment to `sites/default/files/config`:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   terminus drush $SITE.live -- config:export --destination sites/default/files/config
   ```

1. For rsync, copy the sftp host information.

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   RSYNC_HOST=$(terminus connection:info $SITE.live --field=sftp_host)
   ```

1. Use that host name to rsync from `config:export`:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   rsync -rvlz --copy-unsafe-links --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' "${RSYNC_HOST}:files/config" .
   ```

1. If you do a `git status` it should show changed files in the `config` directory if there are any changed configurations in production.

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   git status
   ```

## Upgrade Site Components Locally

1. Use Composer to declare version requirements:

   ```bash{outputLines:2-5,7-9}
    composer require \
      drupal/upgrade_status:^3 \
      drupal/devel:^4 \
      drush/drush:^10 \
      -W --no-update
    composer require \
      phpunit/phpunit:"^8 | ^9 | ^10" \
      phpstan/phpstan \
      --dev -W --no-update
   ```

1. The `pantheon-systems/drupal-integrations` project now includes a patch that backports a bugfix from Drupal 9 to Drupal 8 to display the correct version of your MariaDB server. If this patch is not installed, then your database version will always be reported as `MySQL 5.5.30`.

  The `cweagans/composer-patches` Composer plugin will only install patches from dependencies if the `enable-patching` property is set to `true` in `composer.json`.

  Enable deep patching to view the correct MariaDB version in the Dashboard:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   composer config extra.enable-patching true
   ```

1. Edit `composer.json` and remove `--no-dev` from the `scripts` section to allow the dev dependencies to be available in the integration environment.

  Do not remove the close quote, `"`:

   ```json:title=composer.json
     "scripts": {
       "build-assets": [
         "@prepare-for-pantheon",
         "composer install --optimize-autoloader" //highlight-line
       ],
   ```

1. Add `composer-patches` to the `require` list and run `composer update`:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   composer require cweagans/composer-patches drupal/upgrade_status --no-update
   composer update -W --optimize-autoloader --prefer-dist
   ```

1. If the site doesn't already have a [pantheon.yml](/pantheon-yml#find-or-create-pantheonyml) file, create one with the following values (the comments `#` are optional):

   ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
   api_version: 1
   
   # Move the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your site to the */web* folder:
   web_docroot: true
   
   # Drupal 9 requires PHP 7.3 or higher. If your code isn't ready for PHP 7.4 you may need to use 7.3 here:
   php_version: 7.4
   
   # Drupal 9 requires a higher version of the DB. It will take a few minutes to complete the upgrade to 10.4 once you push this file:
   database:
     version: 10.4
   
   # Drupal 9 prefers Drush 10. If you have written a lot of custom Drush commands you may need to go back to Drush 9 or 8:
   drush_version: 10
   ```

   An existing `pantheon.yml` file may have more values than this in it, but these are the ones with which we are concerned. If the values already exist in the `pantheon.yml` file, change them to the values in this example.

1. Commit and push the changes:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   git add composer.json composer.lock pantheon.yml config/*
   git commit -m 'updating to drush 10/mariadb 10.4/config'
   git push origin d9-upg-21
   ```

  If all goes well, you will see something like the following:

   ```bash
   remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), completed with 3 local objects.
   remote:
   remote: Create a pull request for 'd9-upg-21' on GitHub by visiting:
   remote:      {{URL TO YOUR REPOSITORY}}
   remote:
   ```

1. Copy the URL from the result (line 4 in the previous output) and use your local web browser to navigate to it to create a pull request. Creating a pull request will cause Build Tools to create an **Integration Environment** Multidev. This is called `$ENV` in the next steps.

1. After the build has finished without error, you will see a new environment in the Dashboard under **Multidev** named in reference to your pull request.

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   terminus env:info $SITE.$ENV
   ```

1. Use Terminus Drush to create a one-time login to your site:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   terminus drush $SITE.$ENV uli admin
   ```

1. Log in to the site as admin and take a look under **Reports** at **Upgrade Status**. Any modules which **Upgrade Status** shows are incompatible will need to be updated in the next few steps. Take note of the versions **Upgrade Status** recommends. If your module is incompatible it will need to be removed from the Composer file.

### Upgrade MariaDB in All Environments

Once you have confirmed that the MariaDB upgrade worked in the Multidev, push the changes to the Dev environment to ensure the other components upgrade smoothly.

The possible risks associated with the time it takes for the platform to upgrade the database are minimal, but you can use the following command to mitigate potential errors:

```bash{promptUser: user}
git push origin master
```

From the Dashboard, merge the code from Dev, through Test, to Live.

Or use Terminus, and replace the `$ENV` in this example with the target environment:

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus env:deploy --sync-content --note "upgrade DB" --updatedb -- $SITE.$ENV
```

## Custom Module Code

Custom module code is outside the scope of this document. See [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/creating-custom-modules) for getting your custom code updated with the new version numbers and any code deprecations.

## Use Composer to Update Drupal Core

1. Temporarily add write access to protected files and directories:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   chmod 777 web/sites/default
   find web/sites/default -name "*settings.php" -exec chmod 777 {} \;
   find web/sites/default -name "*services.yml" -exec chmod 777 {} \;
   ```

1. Use Composer to remove `config_installer` and add new requirements:

   ```bash{outputLines: 3-7,9-11}
   composer remove drupal/config_installer --no-update
   composer require drupal/core-recommended:^9 \
      drupal/core-composer-scaffold:^9 \
      drupal/core-project-message:^9 \
      drush/drush:^10 \
      -W --no-update

   composer require phpunit/phpunit:^9 \
      behat/behat:^3 \
      drupal/drupal-extension:^4 \
      --no-update -W --dev
   ```

1. If you have `core-dev` installed, follow below (skip this step if you do not have `core-dev` installed):

   ```bash{outputLines: 2}
   composer require drupal/core-dev:^9 \
      --dev -W --no-update
   ```

1. If the **Upgrade Status** under **Reports** displays obsolete modules, update the modules using the `--no-update -W` switch to instruct Composer to check for all dependencies together rather than for each module. Replace `OBSOLETE-MODULE-NAME` in this example with the module to update:

   ```bash{outputLines: 2}
   composer require drupal/OBSOLETE-MODULE-NAME:^9 \
      --dev -W --no-update
   ```

   Repeat this step for each obsolete module in the project.

1. When you're done updating modules, run `composer update`:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   composer update -W --optimize-autoloader --prefer-dist
   ```

   If this command returns an error, check the output for any incompatible modules or themes and check the **Upgrade Status** under **Reports** in the integration environment.

1. Next, edit `composer.json` and add `--no-dev` from the `scripts` section, to exclude the dev dependencies when the build is deployed to production.

   ```json:title=composer.json
     "scripts": {
       "build-assets": [
         "@prepare-for-pantheon",
         "composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev" //highlight-line
       ],
   ```

1. Commit the changes and push them to the development environment:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   git add composer.json composer.lock pantheon.yml
   git commit -m "upgrade core to d9"
   git push origin d9-upg-21
   ```

## Confirm the MariaDB Version and Updates

Validate your database version with `terminus drush`:

```bash{promptUser: user}
echo 'SELECT VERSION();' | terminus drush $SITE.$ENV sqlq -
```

Review the site and [Launch Check Status tab](/drupal-launch-check) to confirm the database version and any outstanding available updates.
