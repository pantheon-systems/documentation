Drupal 9 includes many of the features and layout that Drupal 8 users are familiar with, and it removes deprecated code to help improve future Drupal development.

Drupal 9 updates Drupalâ€™s underlying dependencies like [Symfony 4.4](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4) and [Twig 2](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/index.html), removes several deprecated API functions in favor of better options, and allows everyone running Drupal 8.8+ an easy upgrade path to Drupal 9 and beyond.

There are a number of ways to upgrade to Drupal 9 on Pantheon, and we're building out the documentation within this guide to try to help you through your adventure.

See our [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) and [Integrated Composer](/integrated-composer) docs to learn more about Drupal 9 on Pantheon, and to get started with a fresh new site.
