This guide is focused on the immediate actions a Pantheon customer should take in the event of a catastrophic site failure. In all cases, the first step should be to file an emergency ticket, a general support ticket, or start a live chat depending on your [account tier](/guides/support/#support-features-and-response-times). Filing an emergency ticket will immediately escalate the incident to our support engineers, and ensure the fastest and most effective service.

This guide does not cover all potential post-disaster recovery processes, as these will depend on the nature of the incident and its impact on your site. It's essential to engage with Pantheon Support during the incident; our team will help determine the necessary remediation steps.
