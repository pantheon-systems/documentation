This guide is focused on the immediate actions a Pantheon customer should take in the event of a catastrophic site failure. In all cases, the first step should be to file an emergency downtime on-call ticket; this will immediately escalate the incident and ensure the fastest and most effective service. 

This guide does not cover all potential post-disaster recovery processes. Such processes will depend on the nature of the incident and the impact that it has on your site. You must engage with Pantheon support during the incident, and the support team will help determine what remediation steps are required.
