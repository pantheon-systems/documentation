## Before You Begin

You should have the **Decoupled** tab enabled in your dashboard after onboarding. To begin using Front-End Site, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

* Your site repository is in GitHub.

* You have a domain to use for the decoupled site.

* You will use Next.js or Gatsby as the frontend framework.

* (Optional) You are using Drupal 9 or WordPress for the CMS.

* (Optional) If using a preconfigured starter kit template, you will use one of the following combinations:

    * Drupal 9 and Next.js

    * WordPress and Gatsby

    > **NOTE**: Other configurations are not currently supported. 


### Compatibility

You can create an application from scratch by importing a repository or you can use the Pantheon starter kit templates to develop a decoupled site. Use the starter kits to create: 

* A server-side rendered applications with Next.js and Drupal

* A static site generated site with Gatsby and WordPress

You can also create a site without a CMS. Create a site from scratch by importing the repository and using Next.js or Gatsby as the static site generator.

The versions that are supported are as follows:

|  Tooling   |      Version    |
|  :---:     |       :---:     |
|  Gatsby    |    4 or higher  |
| Next.js    |   12 or higher  |
|  Drupal    |   9 or higher   |
| WordPress  |   5.9 or higher |


## Site Setup

Front-End Site is available in the New Dashboard, after it is enabled during the customer onboarding process. To access Front-End Site and start developing the frontend application, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your Pantheon Dashboard and navigate to the **Sites** page.

1. Select **Sites** in the the New Dashboard. 

1. Click the **Decoupled** tab, then click **+Create New Site**.

Under the Decoupled Site section on the Site Creation page, click the option that best suits your needs. Ensure you are using compatible versions for the associated tooling before you proceed (e.g. Drupal 9, Next.js v12, etc.).
 

### Connect your Account

You need to configure your frontend to point to the backend. If your Pantheon backend is open, which it is by default, you will be able to connect directly from your local artifact to that repository. 

1. To start you will need to specify the GitHub account associated with your decoupled site. After you select the decoupled site option that best suits your needs, you will be prompted to connect your Git provider. 

1. Select the GitHub option and click **Connect**. A window for GitHub.com is displayed, and you are prompted **“Where do you want to install Pantheon?”**. 

1. Select the repository that you will use to develop your decoupled site. A new page is displayed that confirms where Pantheon should be installed. 

1. Specify the permission configurations and click **Install**. Your GitHub repository is now connected and you can continue with decoupled site creation on the Pantheon dashboard. 


### Create a Site by Importing a Repository

Connect to your Git provider and select an existing repository.

#### Prerequisites 

* You are using a Git repository.

* The repository should not be empty.

* The repository needs to contain only one of the following files:

    * `package-lock.json`
    * `yarn.lock`


#### Site Creation without a Starter Kit 

Create a site with out configuring the backend and link to a frontend framework. To connect your GitHub repository, click **Import Repository** on the _What kind of site are you creating?_ page.

1. If you have not already connected your GitHub account, follow the steps in the Connect your Account section. Otherwise, if your GitHub account is already connected you can proceed to the next step and select your Git provider.

1. Ensure **Make this a private repository** is selected.

1. (Optional) Add configurations.

    * You can add specifications to help manage your root directory, build settings, and set environment variables.
