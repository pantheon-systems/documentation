<Accordion title="Renaming a linked repository in GitHub will cause a break in your decoupled experience." id="rename-repo" icon="info-sign">
Renaming a linked repository in GitHub is not recommended, as it will cause a break in your decoupled experience. In the event a user renames an attached Git repository on GitHub and disconnects the Git repository and attaches the renamed site, this will trigger a false live-build and the Decoupled site will be in a persistent build log state that cannot be canceled. To fix this issue, disconnect the renamed Git repository and revert to the original name. This action will instantly restore all data. Renaming the Git repository on GitHub to the original name should fix the build process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Select files can cause build errors" id="remove-files" icon="info-sign">
Select files, such as `.dockerignore` and `.gcloudignore` files can cause build errors or failed builds. Removing these files from source and adding them to `.gitignore` solves the issue.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Users must have permissions to enable decoupled for GitHub organization accounts." id="github-organization" icon="info-sign">
Users must have permissions to enable decoupled for GitHub organization accounts. The user should be the Owner of the account. GitHub organization owners can allow other users to manage the Pantheon GitHub application on their behalf. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You must remove a VCS user record to uninstall a Front-End Site" id="uninstalling" icon="info-sign">
Uninstalling a Pantheon Front-End Site using GitHub settings requires manual removal of a VCS user record.
