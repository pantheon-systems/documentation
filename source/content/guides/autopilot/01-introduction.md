[Autopilot](https://pantheon.io/autopilot?docs) is part of Pantheon's [New Dashboard](/guides/new-dashboard) experience. Pantheon Autopilot automatically detects, performs, and deploys updates for WordPress and Drupal. Autopilot also features automated virtual regression testing (VRT) to ensure that your site's user experience (UX) is consistent while securing your site and implementing new features.

## What Autopilot Does

Pantheon's Autopilot:

- Automatically detects when new updates are available
- Performs the updates in an isolated [Multidev](/guides/multidev) environment
- Tests the updates with automated visual regression testing (VRT)
- Optionally deploys the updates

Autopilot requires [Multidev](/guides/multidev), and is available to Pantheon Gold Accounts or higher.

Autopilot is enabled for Pantheon sites at the organization level.

## Autopilot Requirements

Autopilot requires the following:

- A Gold, Platinum, or Diamond account
