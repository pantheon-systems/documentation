You can interact with the following checklist to mark steps as completed as you follow along, however progress is not saved and will reset on pageload.

## Additional steps for custom HTTPS certificates
If your requirements do not allow you to use Pantheon's free and managed HTTPS certificate service using Let's Encrypt certificates, you can purchase the option to bring your own custom certificate to the platform instead. [Learn more](/custom-certificates) 

Once purchased, the process for enabling your certificate on Pantheon ahead of your launch includes the following steps: 

| | Todo         | Context |
|---| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
|  <input type="checkbox" /> | Request a Pantheon-generated CSR  | Work with Pantheon support to generate a CSR after you have connected your domains in the site dashboard. <br/><br/>[Learn more](/custom-certificates#add-a-custom-certificate) |
|  <input type="checkbox" /> | Generate new cert bundle | Provide the CSR from Pantheon to your Certificate Authority (CA) so they can generate the new cert bundle in PEM format. |
|  <input type="checkbox" /> | Send cert bundle to Pantheon | Handoff the certificate bundle from your CA to Pantheon support so it can be installed and deployed to the platform. |
|  <input type="checkbox" /> | Test locally | Make sure your custom certificate works as expected locally before pointing your domains to Pantheon. <br/><br/>[Learn more](/custom-certificates#test-before-going-live)
|  <input type="checkbox" /> | Disable Let's Encrypt  | Prevent Let’s Encrypt from issuing certificates for your domains by setting a CAA DNS record to specify which CAs are allowed to issue certificates for your domains.<br/><br/>[Learn more](/custom-certificates#disable-lets-encrypt-with-caa-records) |
