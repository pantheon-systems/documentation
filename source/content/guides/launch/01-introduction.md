Welcome! This guide will help you take a site live on Pantheon.

**In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:**

* Upgrade a site to a paid plan
* Add a custom domain
* Enable free, automated HTTPS
* Redirect traffic to a single domain (e.g., `www.example.com` or `example.com`)
* Enable and schedule weekly backups
* Review status reports
* Optimize performance

To get started, you need to [create your Live environment](/guides/quickstart/create-test-live) and have a registered domain name where you can control DNS settings.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Pantheon is not a domain registrar, and we do not offer DNS management as a service. To connect a custom domain to Pantheon, you need to register one with a third-party provider.
