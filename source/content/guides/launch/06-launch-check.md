## Enable and Schedule Weekly Backups

1. Click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cloud-upload"></span> Backups** on the <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></span> **Dev** tab of your Site Dashboard then click **Backup Schedule**.

1. Toggle to **Enable** if needed, then pick the day you want to create weekly backups on and click **Update Weekly Backup Schedule**.

1. Repeat these steps for the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-equalizer"></span> Test** and **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live** environments.

For more information on this feature, see [Backups Tool](/backups).

## Enable and Test Email Plugin/Module (Optional)

If your site will be sending outgoing email, we *strongly* recommend using a third-party email service provider. See [Email on Pantheon](/email) for more information.

<Alert type="info" title="Note">

Some email solution providers (like Sendgrid) may implement a waiting period before upgrading to a paid plan, to combat malicious email. If you're switching email providers as part of your launch, make sure to research plan for this if applicable.

</Alert>

## Review Status Reports

Launch with confidence by taking advantage of Pantheon's static site analysis service for Drupal and WordPress.

1. Access the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live** environment in your Pantheon Site Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-info-sign"></span> Status** page.

1. The automated report will check for exploited patterns in code, shows database stats, reveals PHP errors, and much more.

For more information on what is included in these checks and how they work, see [Drupal Launch Check](/drupal-launch-check) and [WordPress Launch Check](/wordpress-launch-check).

  **Shoot for all green, but at the very least be sure and fix all errors and review every notice.**

## Level Up: Maximize Performance by Configuring Cache (Optional)


## Ready to launch like the pros?

Since you're in fixin' mode, take some time to optimize performance using Object Cache (formerly Redis) and Pantheon's global CDN.

### [Enable Object Cache](/object-cache)

Pantheon's [Object Cache (formerly Redis)](/object-cache) provides an alternative, drop-in caching backend for your website, taking that work off the database, which is vital for scaling to a larger number of logged-in users. It also provides a number of other nice features for developers looking to use it to manage queues, or do custom caching of their own.

All plans except for a Basic plan can use Redis. Redis is available to Sandbox plans for developmental purposes, but Redis will not be available going live on a Basic plan.

### [Configure Caching](/global-cdn-caching)

Maximize performance on Pantheon by configuring your site's performance settings.

Serving anonymous traffic from virtual memory allows a cached response to be returned to the browser without needing to access the application container, which in turns frees up resources to build more dynamic requests.

### [Test Cache](/test-global-cdn-caching)

Learn how to test whether or not a page is being served from Pantheon's Global CDN by examining the HTTP headers from a response using curl.
