This section provides information on how to configure DNS and provision [free, automated HTTPS](/guides/global-cdn/https) on Pantheon.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If your site is already live and serving HTTPS traffic, and will require HTTPS on Pantheon, return to [Connect a Domain Name](/guides/launch/domains) and complete the steps to pre-provision HTTPS before updating DNS to avoid downtime.

</Alert>

## Test Locally Before Updating DNS (Optional)
 
You can validate that HTTPS configuration for the domain is ready on Pantheon by testing locally before you update your DNS. 

1. Access the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live** environment in your Pantheon Site Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-global"></span> Domains / HTTPS** page.

1. Select **Details** next to the bare domain.

1. Copy the **A** record value provided in the Pantheon Site Dashboard.

1. Add a line to your [local hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) file with the IP address from the previous step followed by the domain name, for example:

          `192.123.456.789 example.com`

    This will tell your computer to look for `example.com` at the new Pantheon address.

1. Make sure your site works with HTTPS by entering your domain with HTTPS in the browser (for example, `https://www.example.com/`).

1. Remove the edits made to your hosts file when you finish testing.

## Configure DNS

The instructions in this section cover the common `example.com` and `www.example.com` domain configuration. Refer to [Platform and Custom Domains](/domains/#custom-domains) for other domain configurations.

You can run diagnostics at [Let's Debug](https://letsdebug.net/) if you are having difficulties issuing a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate. This tool can identify an array of issues specifically for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates, including problems with DNS, nameservers, networking issues, common website misconfigurations, and CA policy issues.
