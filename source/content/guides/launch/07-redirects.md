This section provides information on how to redirect all traffic to a primary domain, which is a best practice for SEO. This means if you choose `www.example.com` as your primary domain, then if a visitor navigates to a bare domain, for example, `example.com` (or any other domain you have connected to your site), they will end up on `https://www.example.com`.

Choose one of the following options to configure the primary domain.

### Update URL References (WordPress)

WordPress site admins must ensure that all URLs in the site's database are updated. See [Fix WordPress Content References to the Wrong Domain After Cloning](/wordpress-broken-links#fix-wordpress-content-references-to-the-wrong-domain-after-cloning) for more information.

### Configure a Long-Duration HSTS Header

You should configure a long-duration HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header, or set up an availability monitoring service to watch over your site after redirecting requests to a single, primary domain.

HSTS instructs browsers to only connect via HTTPS and helps protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. Refer to [Enforce HTTPS + HSTS](/pantheon-yml#enforce-https--hsts) for more information.
