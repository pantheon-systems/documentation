This section provides information on how to upgrade from a free account to a paid plan by adding billing information or inviting a business owner to pay.

Contract customers must contact their account manager when they're ready to upgrade their site plan.

## Use Your Own Card

Add your payment method to upgrade and pay for the site now:

1. Navigate to the Pantheon Site Dashboard, and click **Upgrade** next to the site's name.

1. Click the **Select** button under the [plan you choose](https://pantheon.io/pricing/).

1. Continue to the **Choose Billing** step, and then select the billing frequency: [**Pay Annually**](/annual-billing) or **Pay Monthly**.

   - If you've chosen a **Performance Plan**, choose the size and click **Continue**.

   - If you've chosen a **Basic Plan**, click **Continue**.

1. Click **+ Add New Card** and enter the credit card information, then click **Add Card** to save the card information.

1. Click **Continue** and review your information carefully, then click **Place Your Order** to confirm your purchase.
