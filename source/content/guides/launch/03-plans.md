This section provides information on how to upgrade from a free account to a paid plan by adding billing information or inviting a business owner to pay.

1. Navigate to the Pantheon Site Dashboard, and click **Upgrade** next to the site's name.

1. Click the **Select** button under the [plan you choose](https://pantheon.io/pricing/).

1. Continue to the **Choose Billing** step, and then select the billing frequency: [**Pay Annually**](/guides/account-mgmt/plans/pricing) or **Pay Monthly**.

   - If you've chosen a **Performance Plan**, choose the size and click **Continue**.

   - If you've chosen a **Basic Plan**, click **Continue**.
