This section provides information on how to upgrade from a free account to a paid plan by adding billing information or inviting a business owner to pay.

Contract customers must contact their account manager when they're ready to upgrade their site plan.

## Use Your Own Card

There are several places within the Pantheon Dashboard you can upgrade your site plan:

1.  [Go to the Site Dashboard](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#site-dashboard), and click **Upgrade** next to the site's name.
2.  Within your personal workspace, navigate to Settings>Subscriptions. Click the 'Actions' dropdown and choose, **Change Site Plan**
3.  If you are in a workspace, you can navigate to Settings>Billing. Scroll to see **Supported Sites** table. Within that table, if you are the site owner, you'll be able to click the **Site Plan** column to upgrade or downgrade your site.

From the site upgrade and downgrade page, complete the following steps:

1. Click the **Select** button under the [plan you choose](https://pantheon.io/plans/pricing/). Select the billing frequency: [**Pay Annually**](/guides/account-mgmt/plans/pricing) or **Pay Monthly** at the top of the page.
   - If you've chosen a **Performance Plan**, choose the size and click **Choose Performance**.

   - If you've chosen a **Basic Plan**, click **Continue**.

   - If you've chosen **Custom**, please fill out the contact field to be contacted by a customer support agent.

2. Click **+ Add New Card** and enter the credit card information, then click **Add Card** to save the card information. If you already have a card saved, it should be available in this section.

3. Click **Continue** and review your information carefully, then click **Place Your Order** to confirm your purchase.

   - [Contact Support](/guides/support/contact-support) if you need any help.

As the site owner, you’ll receive an email confirming the change to the site. You’ll receive an updated invoice after the site billing is processed.
