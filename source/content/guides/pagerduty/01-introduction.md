Welcome! This guide will help you configure uptime monitors on a Pantheon Site with New Relic to automatically open an incident in PagerDuty and notify whoever's on-call, following a set escalation path.

**In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:**

* Monitor site uptime and set alert conditions in New Relic
* Create an on-call schedule and escalation policy for your team in PagerDuty
* Integrate New Relic with PagerDuty to send notifications to whoever is on-call (SMS, email, phone call) when an incident occurs
* Integrate PagerDuty with Slack to acknowledge and resolve incidents (optional)

## Before You Begin
To get started, you need to activate [New Relic APM Pro](/docs/new-relic/) on Pantheon:

1. Navigate to the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></span> Live** environment in your Site Dashboard, and click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-eye-open" aria-hidden="true"></span> New Relic**.
2. Click the **Activate New Relic Pro** button.
3. Use the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt" aria-hidden="true"></span> Visit Live Site** and browse your site for a few minutes to generate data in New Relic:
