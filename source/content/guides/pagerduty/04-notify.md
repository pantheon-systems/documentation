In this lesson, we'll configure PagerDuty as a notification channel for our New Relic monitor, so that failures immediately open a new incident and notify on-calls per your team's schedule and escalation policy.

## Create New Service in PagerDuty

Now we'll add a Service, which is any application, component, or team you wish to open incidents against:

1. In your PagerDuty account navigate to  **Configuration** > **Services**, then click **Add New Service**.

1. Enter a name. We suggest using the domain name (e.g., `example.com`) so it's easy to identify services for all your projects over time.

1. Select **New Relic** from the **Integration Type** dropdown menu.

1. Enter a name for the integration, such as "example.com".

1. Click **Add Service**.

1. Copy the integration key to your clipboard.

## New Relic Notification Channels

Now we'll hookup our PagerDuty service as a notification channel for our alert policy in New Relic:

1. Navigate to the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></span> Live** environment in your Site Dashboard, and click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-eye-open" aria-hidden="true"></span> New Relic** then **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt" aria-hidden="true"></span> Go to New Relic**.

1. Go to **Alerts & AI** from the top menu, then **Notification Channels** from the right.

1. Select **New notification channel**

1. Select **PagerDuty** from the dropdown menu, enter a service name and paste the integration key copied in the previous section:

  ![New Relic notification channel](../../../images/pagerduty/new-relic-notification-channels.png)

1. Select the **Alert policies** tab, and **Add alert policies**

1. Select the policy created in the [monitoring](/guides/pagerduty/monitor) part of this guide, and **Save changes**
