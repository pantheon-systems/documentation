In this lesson, we’ll explore your Live site and add an article or post to simulate working on a real production site. Then we’ll clone your Live site “down” to your Dev site.

**Watch the video:**

<Youtube src="UZY0RiKRq7Q" title="Clone Your Live Environment to Dev" />

**Try it yourself:**

1. Click the <Icon icon="new-window-alt" text="Site Admin"/> button to open your Live site in a new tab. You’ll need to log in before being directed to the site administration dashboard.

    <Alert title="Note" type="info">
      Your WordPress or Drupal username and password are the same set you
      created when you installed your Dev site for the first time.
    </Alert>

1. Now let’s create a new Drupal article or WordPress post! If you need help with this step, please reference the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts) or [Drupal Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/administering-drupal-8-site/managing-content/) on how to add a post or article. When finished, visit the front page of your site and confirm that you can see the new content.

1. When you’re done, navigate back to your Site Dashboard. Click the <Icon icon="wrench" text="Dev"/> tab, and open your Dev site by clicking <Icon icon="new-window-alt" text="Visit Development Site"/>.

    Notice that the content you just created on your Live site doesn’t appear here on your Dev site. This is because each environment is a stand-alone copy of your site, with its own codebase, database, and files.

    It’s important to develop on a recent copy of your site with the newest content, so let’s clone your Live site—with its new content—to your Dev environment.

1. Consider creating a backup before proceeding. After Step 7, you will not be able to recover Dev database and files without a backup:

    <Accordion id="create-backup" title="Create Backup (optional)">

    The Backups tab is where you manage all the details for your site's backup. A backup is composed of 3 separate archives for database, files, and code. Let’s create a backup now:

    1. Click <Icon icon="cloud-upload" text="Backups"/> on the <Icon icon="wrench" text="Dev"/> tab of your Site Dashboard.
    2. Click **Create New Backup**.
    3. Click <Icon icon="refresh" text="Deploys"/> to return to the lesson.

    </Accordion>

1. On the <Icon icon="wrench" text="Dev"/> tab of your Site Dashboard click <Icon icon="server" text="Database / Files"/>.

1. To clone the database and files from the Live site, select **Live** from the dropdown menu.

    <Alert type="danger" title="Warning">

    As intended, this action will overwrite your Dev database and files. If you skipped the backup task you will be unable to recover this data hereafter.

    The Clone operation only copies the [files](/files) folder (`wp-content/uploads` or `sites/default/files`) and does not include core, theme, plugins or modules.

    </Alert>

1. Click **Clone the Database & files from Live into the Development Environment**.

1. When this is complete, click <Icon icon="new-window-alt" text="Visit Development Site"/> to confirm that the content you created on your Live site now appears on your Dev site.

Nice work! You added a page to your Live site, then cloned this environment "down" to Dev. Your Dev environment is a safe place for editing code, and now it's up-to-date with your latest content.
