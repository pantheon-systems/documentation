<Accordion title="User Dashboard Glossary (Optional)" id="user-dashboard-tour" icon="lightbulb">

- <Icon icon={"more-windows"} text={"Sites:"}/> Add a new site, view sites you're a team member of, and check how many free sites you have remaining. Return to this page by clicking the Pantheon logo.

  - <Icon icon={"plus"} text={"Create New Site:"}/> Start the process of creating a new site on Pantheon. Once created, it will appear under the Sites tab.

  - **Migrate Existing Site:** Start a guided migration to add a site. If you’re importing a site from your local environment, follow our [manual migration process](/migrate-manual).

- <Icon icon={"group"} text={"Organizations:"}/> If you belong to an organization, you’ll see it listed here. Click it to link to the organization's dashboard.

- <Icon icon={"flag"} text={"Support:"}/> View details of an open support request or create a new support request. Our chat-based support is available 24-hours a day.

- <Icon icon={"cogwheel"} text={"Account:"}/> Update and manage your personal account information. Use the options in the left-hand navigation menu:

  - **Profile:** Update your user profile information, or connect your Google account to Pantheon.

  - **Change Password:** Change your account password.

  - **Login Destination:** Change your Login Destination.

  - **SSH Keys:** Add and manage your SSH keys.

  - **Machine Tokens:** Use machine tokens to uniquely identify your machine and securely authenticate with apps such as [Terminus](/terminus) or the [Pantheon Migration plugin](/migrate).

  - **Billing:** View and update your billing information for sites you own.

  - **Delete Account:** Delete your Pantheon account. This is useful for consolidating multiple accounts under a single user account.
