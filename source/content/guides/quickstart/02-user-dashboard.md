## Tabs

The navigation bar on the left contains several additional tabs to help you manage your sites:

- **Sites:** Add a new site, view sites you're a team member of, and check how many free sites you have remaining. Return to this page by clicking the Pantheon logo.

  - **Create New Site:** Start the process of creating a new site on Pantheon. New sites will appear under the Sites tab.

  - **Migrate Existing Site:** Start a guided migration to add a site. If you’re importing a site from your local environment, follow our [manual migration process](/migrate-manual).  For information about migrating a site from a competitor, or other migration scenarios, refer to [Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/guides/guided/) on our [Get Started](/get-started) page.

- **Team:** If you belong to an organization, you’ll see it listed here. Click the organization name view the organization's dashboard.

- **Autopilot:** [Autopilot](/guides/autopilot) is Visual Regression Testing (VRT) for every WordPress and Drupal Site within your Workspace.

- **Support:** View details of an open support request or create a new support request. Our chat-based support is available 24-hours a day.

- **Custom Upstreams:** Create a new Workspace-specific [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream) using a GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Custom Upstreams allow you to use an external repository as a template for your site.

- **Settings:** Modify the Workspace name, logo, billing information, and if your Organization is configured for it, billing terms and instructions for your team.

## Account Settings

Click your user icon in the upper right corner to update and manage your personal account information. 

  - **Profile:** Update your user profile information, or connect your Google account to Pantheon.

  - **Account and Security:** Change your account email password.

  - **Notifications:** Select the notifications you wish to receive.

  - **SSH Keys:** Add and manage your SSH keys.

  - **Machine Tokens:** Use machine tokens to uniquely identify your machine and securely authenticate with apps such as [Terminus](/terminus).

  - **Preferences:** Flip the toggle to **Off** to use the old dashboard.
