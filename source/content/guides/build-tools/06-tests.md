The Pantheon example projects include some basic tests to validate basic capabilities of the given framework. You can customize these tests and add more to fit your project needs. Drupal 8 uses [Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/) and the WordPress example uses [WordHat](https://wordhat.info/).

The [`behat-pantheon.yml`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer/blob/master/tests/behat/behat-pantheon.yml) file sets the path for a project's collection of Behat tests. Any file with a `.feature` suffix in a listed directory will be executed as part of the standard test run on CircleCI.

There are also visual regression tests using [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) that run when `composer.lock` has changed, but `composer.json` has not. The scripts are a part of the template repositories: [example-wordpress-composer](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer) and [example-drops-8-composer](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer)

## Extending the Example Test Suite

The following is an example of how to increase test coverage for your project by validating site configuration. This test will confirm the [site slogan implemented in a previous lesson](/guides/build-tools/pr-workflow#create-a-pull-request) has been applied to the associated Multidev environment:

1. Pull commits added to the `slogan` branch in the previous lesson:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  git pull origin slogan
  ```

1. Create the directory `tests/site-features` and add a new file called `slogan.feature` that contains the following:

  ```gherkin
  Feature: Confirm that configuration was applied
    In order to know that the Drupal configuration was correctly applied for the tests
    As a website developer
    I need to be able to confirm that the site slogan is correct

    @api
    Scenario: Add a basic page
      Given I am on "/"
      Then I should see "Making the world amazing"
  ```

  It's a relatively simple task to add new tests that exercise your site through its interface. The following example demonstrates testing that an administrator can create with a new page on the site.

1. Create a new file called `content-ui.feature` within the `tests/site-features` directory containing:

  ```gherkin
  Feature: Create Content through Drupal Content UI
    In order to know that the Drupal content UI is working
    As a website administrator
    I need to be able to add a basic page

    @api
    Scenario: Add a basic page
      Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
      And I am on "/node/add/page"
      And I enter "Test Page" for "Title"
      And I press "Save"
      Then I should see "Basic page Test Page has been created."
  ```

  By following this pattern, you can add similar tests to confirm that the most important features of your site remain functional. To save time on test runs, remove the example tests that cover basic Drupal features, and only run tests on your core functionality.

1. Commit your new files to the `slogan` branch and push to GitHub for peer review:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add tests/site-features for content UI and slogan"
  git push origin slogan
  ```

### Behat Test Artifacts

If you create content through a Behat `And I press` phrase, it usually will not be automatically deleted when your test run is complete. Tests that execute custom or non-standard forms may create content that Behat does not know how to remove automatically, and tests that are validated by the existence of this content may show false positives on multiple runs, since the content was created previously.

If you write these sorts of tests, consider writing tests to delete the content they create, to avoid many copies of the same test content from piling up in your Multidev environment.
