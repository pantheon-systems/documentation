This section provides information on how to use and debug the default temporary path, `.tmp`.

<Alert title="Exports" type="export">

This doc uses [Terminus](/terminus) commands. Before you begin, set the variables `$site` and `$env` in your terminal session to match your site name and the correct environment:

```bash
export env=dev
```

</Alert>

## Default Temporary Path

### WordPress

You can get the Pantheon-configured temporary path for WordPress on the [Pantheon Systems WordPress Github](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/blob/default/wp-config-pantheon.php#L67).

### Drupal

We don't recommend changing the temporary settings path for Drupal. Changing the configuration allows temporary files to be shared across application containers, but heavily impacts performance.

Add the code below to your `settings.php` file to get the appropriate configuration for Drupal sites.

```php
/**
 * Drupal
 * Define appropriate location for tmp directory
 */
if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
  if (isset($_SERVER['PRESSFLOW_SETTINGS'])) { 
    // It's necessary to unset the injected PRESSFLOW_SETTINGS to override the values.
    $pressflow_settings = json_decode($_SERVER['PRESSFLOW_SETTINGS'], TRUE); 
    unset($pressflow_settings['conf']['file_temporary_path']); 
    unset($pressflow_settings['conf']['file_directory_temp']); 
    $_SERVER['PRESSFLOW_SETTINGS'] = json_encode($pressflow_settings); 
  } 
  $conf['file_temporary_path'] = $_SERVER['HOME'] .'/tmp';
  $conf['file_directory_temp'] = $_SERVER['HOME'] .'/tmp';
}
```

## Fix Unsupported Temporary Path

Errors caused by an unsupported temporary path typically surface as permission errors for `.tmp` files and can be replicated on any environment.

<TabList>

<Tab title="WordPress" id="wptmppath" active={true}>

You must correct an unsupported temporary path set by a plugin or theme in the `wp-config.php` file.

1. Replace `SOME_TMP_SETTING` with the conflicting plugin or theme option. For example:

  ```php
  if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
    define('SOME_TMP_SETTING', $_SERVER['HOME'] . '/tmp');
  }
  ```

1. Run `wp config get`in [Terminus](/terminus) to verify the setting:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus wp $site.$env -- config get SOME_TMP_SETTING
  ```

The output for this command should look similar to the following Contact Form 7 example:

![config get wpcf7 uploads tmp dir default](../../../images/wp-config-get-tmp-default.png)

</Tab>

<Tab title="Drupal 7" id="d7tmppath">

You must correct an unsupported temporary path set by a module or theme using `$conf` override in the `settings.php` file.

1. Replace `some_tmp_setting` with the conflicting module or theme setting. For example:

  ```php
  if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
    $conf['some_tmp_setting'] = $_SERVER['HOME'] . '/tmp';
  }
  ```

1. Run `drush variable-get` in [Terminus](/terminus) to verify the setting:

  ```bash
  terminus drush $site.$env -- variable-get some_tmp_setting
  ```

The output for this command should look similar to the following Plupload example:

![cget plupload settings temporary_uri filesystem](../../../images/d7-vget-tmp-default.png)

    $settings['file_temp_path'] = $_SERVER['HOME'] . '/tmp';
  }

  ```bash
  terminus drush $site.$env -- config:get some_tmp_setting
  ```

## Multiple Application Containers

Errors caused by this scenario occur on production environments (Test or Live) and typically reference some `.tmp` file as not found and could not be copied. These errors cannot be replicated on development environments (Dev or Multidev) because those environments use a single application container.

Sites on the Performance Medium plan and above have multiple [application containers](/application-containers). The platform routes requests across available application containers based on their load to help sites perform at scale.

The default temporary path (`$_SERVER['HOME'] . '/tmp'`) is not synchronized across application containers which causes operations that expect this path to persist will fail.

### Considerations

It's uncommon for a plugin, module, or theme to use the temporary path in a way that results in such errors. We suggest reporting the issue to the author and replacing the conflicting plugin, module, or theme whenever possible until a fix is released.

Be aware that temporary files are not cleaned up automatically in the following configuration, which can result in [highly populated directories](/guides/filesystem/large-files).

### Persistent Temporary Path Workaround

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

There's generally no need for temporary files to persist across application containers. You can use a different plugin or module to avoid a performance hit that accompanies the workaround below. The following workaround is potentially dangerous and may result in downtime if the offending plugin is very active writing to the temporary files.

<Tab title="WordPress" id="wpworkaround" active={true}>

You must configure a temporary path that uses a private subdirectory of Pantheon's networked filesystem in the `wp-config.php` file.

1. Verify that you have the `private` and `tmp` directories. These directories do not exist by default. You must create the folders via SFTP if you have not done so already. We do not recommend using a public path because core treats the temporary path as non-web-accessible by default.

1. Replace `SOME_TMP_SETTING` with the conflicting plugin or theme option:

    ```php
    if (isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
      define('SOME_TMP_SETTING', '/wp-content/uploads/private/tmp');
    }
    ```

1. Run `wp config get` in [Terminus](/terminus) to verify the setting:

    ```bash
    terminus wp $site.$env -- config get SOME_TMP_SETTING
    ```
