<Alert title="Early Access" type="info" icon="leaf">

WordPress Multisite (WPMS) Search and Replace is available for [Early Access](/oss-support-levels#early-access) participants. Features for platform search and replace on WPMS sites are in active development. Pantheon's development team is rolling out new functionality often while this product is in Early Access. Visit [#wordpress in our community Slack](https://pantheon-community.slack.com/archives/CT8MC5Y0K) (you can sign up for the [Pantheon Slack channel here](https://slackin.pantheon.io/) if you don't already have an account) to learn how you can enroll in our Early Access program. Please review Pantheon's [Software Evaluation Licensing Terms](https://legal.pantheon.io/#contract-hkqlbwpxo) for more information about access to our software.

</Alert>

This section provides information on how to configure automatic platform Search and Replace for URLs. This feature can be used with both subdirectory and subdomain WordPress Multisites.

## Requirements

You must have the following to enable Search and Replace:

- A [WordPress Multisite](/guides/multisite)

<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

If your `pantheon.yml` file is different between environments, the `search_replace` value in your source environment’s `pantheon.yml` file will determine if the job runs or not. When you create a Multidev, the source environment is where you clone the database and files from.

</Alert>

## Subdirectory WordPress Multisite Search and Replace Configuration

Enabling Search and Replace for Subdirectory Multisites requires a `true` value for the `search_replace` parameter in your `pantheon.yml`.
<!--No additional configuration is needed for Subdirectory Multisite Search and Replace. Search and Replace will match the behavior of the platform’s Search and Replace for non-WPMS sites. TODO: Before GA, add note about explicitlly DISABLING S&R.-->

```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
search_replace: true
```

## Subdomain WordPress Multisite Search and Replace Configuration
Search and Replace runs on the platform as part of creating an environment, deploying to Test or Live, and when cloning content between environments. There is currently a limit of 25 sites that can be configured for search and replace. We expect this number to increase before General Availability.

By default, Subdomain Multisites do not run any Search and Replace. Enabling Search and Replace for Subdomain Multisites requires setting the `search_replace` value to `custom` in `pantheon.yml` and creating a `sites.yml`. Environments that need to be replaced are defined and paired in the `sites.yml` file for subdomain Multisites. Search and replace runs for each domain listed in the source environment that has a matching key in the target environment. If Search and Replace is enabled for an environment, but the `sites.yml` file does not exist, nothing will be updated. If the `sites.yml` file is different between environments, the `domain_maps` in the target environment’s `sites.yml` file will be used to determine what is replaced.

1. In your `pantheon.yml` file, set the `search_replace` value to `custom`.

  ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
  search_replace: custom
  ```

1. Create a `sites.yml` file inside the `private/` folder.

1. Define and pair the environments to be replaced like the sample code below.

    ```yaml:title=private/sites.yml
    ---
    api_version: 1 # Currently only one api version.
    # file should be placed in the /private folder
    # "domain_maps" is a collection of blog URLs for each environment used to
    # facilitate search-replace of a WordPress Multisite (WPMS) across pantheon
    # environments. Each key of "domain_maps" must be a valid environment name.
    domain_maps:
      # environment: <collection of domains to be used on this environment>
      # i.e. dev, test, live, feat-branch, &c.
      dev:
        # each environment collection maps the blog ID to its URL. A url must be
        # set in both the target and source environments for search-replace to be
        # run.
        # i.e. 2: blog1-mysite.com
        1: dev-example.pantheonsite.io
        2: dev.about.example.com
        3: dev.employee.example.com
        4: dev.staff-portal.example.com
        5: dev.customers.example.com
        6: dev.hr-department.example.com
      test:
        1: test-example.pantheonsite.io
        2: test.about.example.com
        6: test.hr-department.example.com
      live:
        1: www.example.com
        2: about.example.com
        3: employee.example.com
        4: staff-portal.example.com
        5: dcustomers.example.com
        6: hr-department.example.com
      multidev1:
        1: multidev1-example.pantheonsite.io
        2: multidev1.about.example.com
        3: multidev1.employee.example.com

     # Anything else in the file will be ignored, but not rejected.

    ```

1. Validate the `sites.yml` file (recommended) with Pantheon's `sites-yml-validator` utility available [on GitHub](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/sites-yml-validator). The project's `README` file includes details on how to install and use the utility.

1. Commit the  `sites.yml` file in the `private/sites.yml` in the site’s Git repository.

## Subdomain to Subdirectory Multisite Conversion

Sites can also be configured to use Subdomain Multisite in the Live environment, and Subdirectory in all other environments.

To configure this:

1. In your `pantheon.yml` file, set the `search_replace` value to `convert`.

  ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
  search_replace: convert
  ```

1. Open your `wp-config.php` file and locate the `SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL` key.

1. Set the `SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL` value to conditional:

    ```php:title=wp-config.php
    if ( ! empty( $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] ) && $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] ==  'live' ) {
      define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', true );
    }
    ```

    - This step is not required, but ensures that you can create new sites as subdomain sites in the Live environment while your other environments create the new sites as subdirectory sites.

The domain map in the `sites.yml` file is not necessary when converting from subdomain to subdirectory structure. When cloned, subdomains, domains, and subdirectories on the Live site will convert with the following pattern:

* `site.com`           => `test-site.pantheonsite.io`
* `blog.site.com`      => `test-site.pantheonsite.io/blog/`
* `blog.site.com/dir/` => `test-site.pantheonsite.io/blog-dir/`
* `blog.com`           => `test-site.pantheonsite.io/blog-com/`
* `blog.com/dir/`      => `test-site.pantheonsite.io/blog-com-dir/`

Sites configured for subdomain conversion will _only_ run the conversion step from Live to a non-live environment. All other workflows assume a subdirectory-to-subdirectory search and replace. There is no limit on domains when using the conversion step.

## `search_replace` Parameter Reference

* `_null_`: No `search_replace` value. Defaults to `false`.<!-- TODO: ADD NOTE THAT THIS DEFAULTS TO TRUE IN GA -->
* `true`: Runs a Search and Replace for a Subdirectory multisite.
* `false`: Do not run Search and Replace at all.
* `custom`: Run Search and Replace based on the domain map in `sites.yml`. Requires a valid `sites.yml` to exist.
* `convert`: Run Subdomain to Subdirectory conversion when cloning from the Pantheon Live environment, and Subdirectory to Subdirectory in all other cases.

## Known Issues

* WordPress Multisites that are using the WordPress (Composer Managed) upstream are currently unable to use Multisite Search and Replace. For those sites, we recommend setting the `search_replace` value to `false` and using WP-CLI via Terminus to perform the Search and Replace. See [Run WP-CLI `search-replace`` Manually](/guides/multisite/workflows/#run-wp-cli-search-replace-manually) for more information.
