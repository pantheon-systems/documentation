You're just about to configure your WordPress Site Network.

Our expectation at this point is that you have a new WordPress Site Network created for you by a Pantheon employee. If you do not yet have a WordPress Site Network, refer to the [introduction](/guides/multisite) page of this guide. When you visit the Dev environment's site URL, you should be redirected to WordPress' web-based installer.

Adjust placeholders in code snippets as needed throughout this guide. This includes placeholders such as `<site>` and `<env>` within Terminus commands, in addition to placeholders wrapped in `<>` brackets within larger code blocks.

## Install the WordPress Site Network

Using [Terminus](/terminus) is our recommended way to install a WordPress Site Network.

1. Install the most recent release of Terminus:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-installer/master/builds/installer.phar && php installer.phar install
  ```

1. [Generate a Machine Token](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/machine-token/create), then authenticate Terminus:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    terminus auth:login --machine-token=<machine-token>
    ```

1. Make sure the site's connection mode is set to SFTP:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    terminus connection:set <site>.dev sftp
    ```

1. Use Terminus to execute the `wp core multisite-install` command ([full documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/multisite-install/)):

  <Alert title="Note" type="info">

  The default behavior for this command is to create a Site Network with the subdirectory configuration. To create your network with the subdomain configuration, add the `--subdomains` flag.

  </Alert>

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus wp <site>.<env> -- core multisite-install --url=<url> --title=<site-title> --admin_user=<username> --admin_email=<email>
  ```

  When you install a new WordPress Site Network, you should see a success notice similar to this:

  ```bash{outputLines: 2-6}
  terminus wp sitenetworks.dev -- core multisite-install --url=dev-sitenetworks.pantheonsite.io --title="Site Networks" --admin_user=aghost --admin_email=aghost@pantheon.io
  Admin password: abcdefgnotarealpassword
  Created single site database tables.
  Set up multisite database tables.
  Added multisite constants to 'wp-config.php'.
  Success: Network installed. Dont forget to set up rewrite rules.
  ```

Et voila! Your WordPress Site Network is now installed.

## Configure the WordPress Site Network

The `wp core multisite-install` command we ran in the previous section modifies the `wp-config.php` file. One of those modifications sets the `DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE` constant, which fixes your WordPress Site Network to a specific URL.

In order for things to run smoothly on Pantheon, we need to adjust the configuration so that the `DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE` constant is defined conditionally based on the given environment:

1. Navigate to **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-embed-close"></span> Code** in the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-wrench"></span> Dev** tab of your Site Dashboard.

1. Click **Connect with SFTP** to access the credentials for connecting to your preferred SFTP client.

1. Click **Open SFTP client**, and enter your User Dashboard password when prompted.

  If you run into issues, please refer to Pantheon's [SFTP documentation](/sftp#sftp-connection-information).

1. Open the `code` folder in your SFTP client, and download your site's `wp-config.php` file.

1. Locate the configuration added by WP-CLI, and comment out the line that sets `DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE`. For example:

  ```php:title=wp-config.php
  define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );
  define( 'MULTISITE', true );
  define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false );
  $base = '/';
  # define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'example.com' );
  define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );
  define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
  define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
  ```

1. Add the following code block to your `wp-config.php` file, under the lines mentioned in the previous step:

  ```php:title=wp-config.php
  /**
   * Define DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE conditionally.
   */
  if ( ! empty( $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] ) ) {
    switch( $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] ) {
      case 'live':
        // Value should be the primary domain for the Site Network.
        define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'live-<site>.pantheonsite.io' );
        // Once you map a domain to Live, you can change DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE
        // define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'example-network.com' );
        break;
      case 'test':
        define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'test-<site>.pantheonsite.io' );
        break;
      case 'dev':
        define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'dev-<site>.pantheonsite.io' );
        break;
      default:
        # Catch-all to accommodate default naming for multi-dev environments.
        define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] . '-' . $_ENV['PANTHEON_SITE_NAME'] . '.pantheonsite.io' );
        break;
      }
  }
  ```

  The astute programmer will notice the `test` and `dev` cases are redundant. Feel free to remove if you don't intend to add custom domains to those environments. Generally, the key idea is that you're conditionally defining the `DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE` constant based on the current Pantheon environment (Dev, Test, Live or Multidev).

1. Save your changes and upload the `wp-config.php` file to Pantheon's Dev environment once edits are complete.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

A warning may appear in the WordPress dashboard that you need to update your `.htaccess` file. Since Pantheon used Nginx and your site is already pre-configured for multisite by your Account Manager, you can ignore this warning.

## Developing the Site Network

Congratulations on setting up your first WordPress Site Network. You are on your way to glory! When logged in to the WordPress Dashboard, you'll see a new **My Sites** menu item in the toolbar:

![Enabling the network](../../../images/wp-network-admin-sites.png)

You will have one site â€” go ahead and create another if you'd like. If you chose to use WordPress Site Networks with subdirectories, you'll be able to access the site right away. If you chose to use subdomains, you'll need to map a custom hostname to the environment before you can access the new environment.

<Accordion title="Mapping Custom Hostnames"  id="map-cust-hostname" icon="wrench">

### Mapping Custom Hostnames (subdomain configurations only)

Upon installation and configuration the main site will load properly (e.g., `dev-<example>.pantheonsite.io`). However, additional network sites created will fail to load because `pantheonsite.io` doesn't support sub-sub-domains (e.g., `<new-sub-site>.dev-<example>.pantheonsite.io`). WordPress Site Networks using a subdomain configuration require custom domains to be mapped to each network site in order to load properly.

1. Access the domain's DNS settings wherever they are managed.
1. Create a wildcard CNAME `*.dev.example.com` that maps to the Dev environment's platform domain, `dev-<example>.pantheonsite.io`. Doing so ensures all hostnames mapped to the environment will load without additional DNS records.
1. Map domains to the Pantheon Dev environment via Terminus. For example:

    ```bash
    # add dev.example.com for the network's main site
    terminus domain:add <site>.dev dev.example.com

    # add subsite.example.com for a subsite on the network
    terminus domain:add <site>.dev subsite.example.com
    ```

1. Update the conditional `DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE` definition in your `wp-config.php` file to accommodate the site's new domains.

Once these steps are complete, both sites on the WordPress Site Network should load over their new URLs.

Spend some additional time exploring the WordPress Network Dashboard to become familiar with the variety of additional settings you now have. Take a look at what options are available for each site you create, how to manage users across WordPress Multisite, and the grab bag of network settings.

Once you're ready to move on, the next section covers using a WordPress Site Network with the Pantheon Workflow.
