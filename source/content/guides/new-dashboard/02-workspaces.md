## What is a Workspace?

Workspaces are the improved version of the old Dashboards, combined into one place.

If you're a member of multiple [Organizations](/organizations), you can stay logged in, and switch between Workspaces to work on personal projects or between Organizations.

### Switch Between Workspaces

Switch between Workspaces by clicking the Organization’s name and icon in the upper left:

## Sites

The **<i className="fa fa-window-restore"></i> Sites** tab shows a table of all the Sites your user has access to within the current Workspace. Filter by Plan, Upstream, Status, or owner from the left, or use the buttons in the upper right to migrate an existing site or to create a new site.

Click a table heading to sort the table by that heading.

## Team

Manage Team members and assign [roles and permissions](/change-management#roles-and-permissions). If you're working with a [Partner Agency](https://pantheon.io/plans/partner-program?docs), add them as a Supporting Organization here.
## Autopilot

[Autopilot](/guides/autopilot) is Visual Regression Testing (VRT) for every WordPress and Drupal Site within your Workspace.

Once it's enabled, use it to visually compare changes to the site. Visit the [Autopilot documentation](/guides/autopilot) for more information.

## Upstreams

Create a new Workspace-specific [Custom Upstream](/custom-upstream) using a GitHub or Bitbucket repository.

## Support

Chat with Pantheon Support or access and create new Support tickets.

## Settings

Use the **Settings** tab to modify the Workspace name, logo, billing information, and if your Organization is configured for it, billing terms and instructions for your team.
