## Autopilot

After you Activate Autopilot on a site, you can view whether your sites have a status of: Autopilot Enabled, Needs Review, or has Errors. 

Search sites by name and get quick access to details such as when a site was last updated, the deployment destination, status, and the update frequency. To manage settings or apply updates, click **Actions**. 

Autopilot on Pantheon automatically detects new site updates and tests them with automated visual regression testing.

You have the option to discard the test, accept changes, approve, or do more, such as add a threshold or view the Multidev. Click **More Actions** to be directed to the Legacy Dashboard.
