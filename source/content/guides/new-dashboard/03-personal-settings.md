## SSH Keys

SSH keys allow you to establish a secure connection between your computer and Pantheon. Visit the SSH Keys tab to review your existing configured keys, and add or revoke SSH keys. Follow the steps in [SSH Keys](/ssh-keys) to generate, add, and revoke SSH keys. 


## Machine Tokens

Machine tokens are used to uniquely identify your machine and securely authenticate via Terminus.

The token key will only be shown once and provides the same access as your username and password. To learn more about machine tokens, refer to the [Creating and Revoking Machine Tokens](/machine-tokens) documentation.
