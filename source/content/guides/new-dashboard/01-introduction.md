Alternatively, you can navigate to your existing Dashboard, then add `/beta/workspace/` between `pantheon.io` and your [UUID](/glossary#uuid). For example: `pantheon.io/beta/workspace/de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014`. You'll be immediately directed to the default Workspace on the New Dashboard. Click **Sites** on the left to access the Sites view.
