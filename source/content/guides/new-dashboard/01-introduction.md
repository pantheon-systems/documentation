Alternatively, you can navigate to your existing Dashboard, then add `/beta/workspace/` between `pantheon.io` and your [UUID](/glossary#uuid). For example: `pantheon.io/beta/workspace/de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014`. You'll be immediately directed to the default Workspace on the New Dashboard. Click **Sites** on the left to access the Sites view.

## Features of the New Dashboard

### Autopilot

[Autopilot](https://pantheon.io/autopilot?docs) tracks and implements changes, and alerts you if something looks off. See the [Autopilot](/guides/autopilot) documentation to learn how to use Autopilot to handle your WebOps.

### Pantheon Support

The same great [Support](/support) you already love. The New Dashboard makes it easier to find the right resources, whatever your question is, wherever you are in your Workspace.

## Utility Navigation

Your user icon, Gravatar, or <i className="fa fa-user-circle"></i> by default, gives you quick access to your User Settings and information about who you're logged in as.

### Workspaces

Each Workspace is a portal for all your Site and Organization WebOps needs.

Switch between Workspaces to manages each one's Sites, Users, Upstreams, and settings.
