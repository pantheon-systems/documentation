You can manage all the invoices in your workspace. The Invoices page lists the payment options used and helps you easily check payments on all invoices.


## Invoice Details

The details in the invoice include:

|Invoice item| Description|
|------------|------------|
|Subscription Number / Site Name| The primary site name of your site in the workspace|
|Bill To| The address specified for the payment method|
|Product Detail| The account and associated usage or commitment renewal|
|Unit Price| Cost for subscription|
|Method| Credit card used|

You can download the invoice as a PDF or CSV file. You can also print the PDF or import the CSV into a spreadsheet program.

If your billing country is in the European Union (EU), your invoices may also include the value-added tax (VAT) ID.
These invoices comply with the EU requirements of the VAT Directive (Article 226, Council Directive 2006/112/EC) and are valid for your local tax authorities. 


## Sort Invoices

You can view your invoices by clicking **Invoices** from the Billing menu. On the Invoices page, you have options on how to find the specific invoices you are looking for and how to sort them.

Invoices can be sorted by:

* Invoice date
* Invoice number
* Payment method
* Payment amount

You can also use the search bar to find a specfic invoice. Enter keywords, methods, dates, or amounts in the search bar to yield results.
