In this section, we explain what an HTTP Archive (HAR) format file is and how to generate a HAR file in the affected browser.

## HAR (HTTP Archive format)

A HAR file is a JSON file that you generate to track all logs of a web browser's interaction with a website. It is used to troubleshoot performance and page rendering issues such as slow page loads, timeouts, incorrect page formats, and missing information.

It is recommended that you generate multiple HAR files, for comparison. For example, you can generate a HAR file for a page that is performing normally, as well as for the page that is having issues.
