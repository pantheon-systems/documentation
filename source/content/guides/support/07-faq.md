### Can I request a feature be added to the platform?

Yes. For more details, talk to your Customer Success Manager or [contact sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us).

### Is there a support number we can call? Is this service available for all account tiers?

Diamond and Platinum customers can call the 24/7 Premium Support Hotline  for any technical issues, escalations, site, billing, or overages queries. You can find the phone number in the Support tab of your workspace. Note that this is strictly for filing a ticket, and you will not reach a support engineer by using this method.

### Is there 24/7 support for emergencies like incidents or outages? Is this service available for all account tiers?

Diamond and Platinum customers can open an emergency ticket for business-critical issues. Pantheon escalates emergency tickets to our support engineers, even during off-hours. To ensure effective triage, please open the emergency ticket from the workspace of the affected site.

### What if I can't login to the Pantheon Dashboard?

If you are unable to log in, try [resetting your password](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/reset-password).

### How can I review my chat threads?

Access support history for chats in the Workspace or Site Dashboards by selecting **Support** > **Launch Chat**.

### Can I start a chat session via email?

No. Initiate chats via the Pantheon User or Site Dashboards.

### Can I respond to an existing chat message via email?

Yes. Reply directly to the email thread to continue an existing chat session and update the chat history on the Dashboard.

### Who do I talk to about billing questions?

The best way to get help with your billing questions is to contact our support team [via chat](#real-time-chat-support) or through a [ticket](#ticket-support).
