title: Create a Custom Upstream
description: Connect a remote repository with Pantheon to use as a starting point for new sites.
categories: [develop]
tags: [upstreams, workflow, webops]
---

Pantheon Custom Upstreams are a self-serve feature available to anyone with access to the [Organization](/organizations) Dashboard of an eligible plan. Once an Organization Administrator creates a Custom Upstream, members of the organization will be able to create new sites from a set common codebase. For an overview of this feature, see [Introduction to Custom Upstreams](/custom-upstream). In order to use a specific Custom Upstream on multiple Organizations, the upstream must be created within each Organizationâ€™s Dashboard.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Be aware that support for Custom Upstreams is limited to verification that the externally hosted upstream repository is connected properly to the platform. For details, see [Get Support](/support/#custom-upstreams).

</Alert>

## Create and Host the Repository Remotely

This remote repository serves as the central location for the development and maintenance of your Custom Upstream. Changes are tracked here and distributed downstream to sites within your Organization as one-click updates in the Site Dashboard.

Choose your preferred Git host:

   ![GitHub Initialization options](../images/github-avoid-readme.png)

  <Alert type="info" title="Note">

  As of October 1st, 2020, all new repositories on GitHub are initialized with the default branch name `main`.

  As a company, Pantheon is trying to use [more inclusive language in our repositories](https://pantheon.io/blog/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-pantheon?docs). While our team works to make Custom Upstreams less reliant on older naming conventions, new Custom Upstreams currently default to using the `master` branch name.

  Git's default naming convention differs from GitHub's. If you don't initialize the repository on GitHub, Git will assign the default branch name as `master` when you clone the repository locally.

</Tab>

</TabList>

## Pull in Core from Pantheon's Upstream

To avoid incompatibilities, you must track Pantheon's corresponding upstream repository within the Custom Upstream.

1. Navigate to the Custom Upstream's root directory using the command line, then add the appropriate Pantheon Upstream as a [remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote):

    <TabList>

    <Tab title="WordPress" id="wp1" active={true}>

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-wordpress git://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Drupal 9" id="d91">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-drupal-9 git://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-project.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Drupal 8" id="d81">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-drops-8 git://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title=" Drupal 7" id="d71">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git remote add pantheon-drops-7 git://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7.git
    ```

    </Tab>

    </TabList>

1. Now that the Custom Upstream repository is tracking the corresponding Pantheon core upstream, we can pull in core:

    <TabList>

    <Tab title="WordPress" id="wp1" active={true}>

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git checkout -b master
    git fetch pantheon-wordpress
    git merge pantheon-wordpress/master
    git push origin master
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Drupal 9" id="d91">

    1. Pull and commit the core files:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     git checkout -b master
     git fetch pantheon-drupal-9 master
     git merge pantheon-drupal-9/master
     git push origin master
     ```

    1. Drupal 9 on Pantheon includes [Integrated Composer](/integrated-composer) to manage dependencies. This adds a separate `composer.json` file in the `upstream-configuration` directory.

     Change to it and use `composer require` to add packages to the Upstream, then set the `config version` to a number that makes sense for you:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     cd upstream-configuration
     composer require drupal/pkg-name --no-update
     ```

       Note that the optional `--no-update` flag in this command should only be used in Upstreams (as we do here) to instruct Composer not to check for updates now. See [How to Add Dependencies to Your Upstream](/integrated-composer#how-to-add-dependencies-to-your-upstream) for more information about adding dependencies.

    1. Commit and push the changes:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     git commit -am "added composer dependencies"
     git push origin master
     ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Drupal 8" id="d81">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git checkout -b master
    git fetch pantheon-drops-8
    git merge pantheon-drops-8/master
    git push origin master
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title=" Drupal 7" id="d71">

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    git checkout -b master
    git fetch pantheon-drops-7
    git merge pantheon-drops-7/master
    git push origin master
    ```

    </Tab>

    </TabList>

    - **Username**: We suggest setting a custom username to provide to Pantheon Support.
    - Give the token the **read_repository** scope.

    ![Adding a deploy token to a GitLab repository](../images/gitlab-deploy-token.png)

1. After you click **Create deploy token**, save the token immediately to provide to Pantheon Support. GitLab will not show it again.

1. [Contact support](/support) to add the Custom Upstream to your org. You must provide:

   - A name for the Custom Upstream,
   - The `https` clone URL (ending in `.git`),
   - The Username and Access Token for the deploy token.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Other" id="other-auth">

Custom Upstreams from other repository hosts must be created for you by Pantheon Support.
  
These are common steps needed for most Git Providers:

1. Prepare a new user specifically for Pantheon access.

1. This new account will need to be accessible via API for Pantheon, it must also have access to the repository created in the earlier step.

1. [Contact support](/support) to add the Custom Upstream to your org. You must provide:

    - A name for the Custom Upstream,

    - The CMS within (WordPress, Drupal 7/8/9),

    - The `https` clone URL (ending in `.git`),

    - The username and Access Token for the new user,

    - The name of the branch to be used by Pantheon (usually `master`).

</Tab>

</TabList>

## Edit Existing Custom Upstream Settings

If you would like to change the name or description of your Custom Upstream:

1. Navigate to the **[<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Organizations](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/#organizations")** tab within the Pantheon Dashboard and select your organization.

1. Select the **<span class="upstreams-regular"></span> Upstreams** tab.

1. Click **Settings** next to the existing upstream requiring an update.

1. Make desired changes, then click **Update**.

### Initial Connection Mode

The default connection mode for new sites created from a Custom Upstream is Git for WordPress and Drupal 7. Drupal 8 and Drupal 9 default to SFTP connection mode.

Configure this setting after connecting your Custom Upstream to Pantheon if new sites need to use an initial connection mode other than the default:

1. Navigate to the **[<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Organizations](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/#organizations" )** tab within the Pantheon Dashboard and select your organization.

1. Select the **<span class="upstreams-regular"></span> Upstreams** tab.

1. Click **Settings** next to the existing upstream requiring an update.

1. Select the desired connection mode, then click **Update**:

  ![Modify initial connection mode](../images/dashboard/initial-connection-mode.png)

New sites created from this Custom Upstream will use this connection mode by default going forward.

### Repository URL and password

You cannot modify the repository details on existing Custom Upstreams. If there is a new URL or password you need to use, we recommend creating a new Custom Upstream and switching each site to the new upstream individually with [Terminus](/terminus):

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus site:upstream:set my-site "My New Custom Upstream"
```

You must be a site owner to switch a site's upstream. After a site's upstream has been changed, you will need to merge changes as a one-click update. For details, see [Example Usage](/terminus/examples/#switch-upstreams).

Once all sites have been updated to track the new Custom Upstream, you can safely delete the old one:

1. Navigate to the **[<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-group"></span> Organizations](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/#organizations" )** tab within the Pantheon Dashboard and select your organization.

1. Select the **<span class="upstreams-regular"></span> Upstreams** tab.

1. Click **Settings** next to the existing upstream, then click **Delete**.

## Switch an Existing Site to a Custom Upstream

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

Switching the upstream of an existing site is risky. Consider creating a new site from your Custom Upstream and migrating the contents. If you must switch upstreams, [back up](/backups) your site first, and consider our documentation on [upstream merge conflicts](/core-updates/#apply-upstream-updates-manually-from-the-command-line-to-resolve-merge-conflicts).

</Alert>

Only a Site Owner, User in Charge, or Organization Administrator can change an existing site to use a new Custom Upstream using [Terminus](/terminus):

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus site:upstream:set $site $upstream_id
```

In the example above, set or replace the variables `$site` and `$upstream_id` with your site name and upstream machine name, respectively. You can find your Custom Upstream's machine name using `terminus org:upstream:list $org`, where `$org` is your organization name.
