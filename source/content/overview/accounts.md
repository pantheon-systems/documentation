Learn how to set up your teams, use your dashboards, and how billing works. You should be able to comfortably develop an organization plan and administer your Pantheon platform after reading this section.

## Organizations

Pantheon Organizations bring together users, sites, Custom Upstreams, Multidev environments, and support to provide administrators with the tools needed to effectively manage a large number of sites. If you are an Administrator or Team Member for your Organization, you can access support requests, add or remove organizational team members, and manage new or existing sites.

Your Organization Dashboard allows you to manage your:
- Sites
- Organization Team
- Organization Settings
- And Support, across all of your sites


Refer to [Organizations](/organizations) for details. 

## Roles

Users added to the organization can access all sites associated with the organization, with access restricted based on the user's role in that organization. These roles exist to restrict who can deploy code on sites, and manage other users in the organization or sites it works on.

Refer to [Change Management](/change-management) for more details.

## Dashboards

The [User Dashboard](/user-dashboard) provides access to all of your sites and account information. This is the page you'll land on when you first log in.

The [Organization Dashboard](/organization-dashboard) is where Organization Administrators and Team Members manage all their sites in a single location. If you are an Administrator or Team Member for your Organization, you can access support requests, add or remove organizational team members, and manage new or existing sites.

Each site on the User and Organization Dashboards opens a [Site Dashboard](/site-plan) where you manage [sites](/site-plan/), [metrics](/metrics/) and [billing](/site-billing/). The Site Dashboard provides the most options and is the most flexible of your spaces on Pantheon. 

## Pricing

Refer to our [Pantheon Pricing Comparison](https://pantheon.io/pricing-comparison) for more information.

## Billing

Billing can be managed in one of two places:

- For specific sites, billing is managed via the [Site Dashboard](/site-billing).
- For the entire account, billing is managed via the [User Dashboard](/account-billing)

Billing can be done monthly or annually.

- [Monthly billing](/guides/new-dashboard/workspace-billing/subscriptions) is the default option.
  
- [Annual billing](/annual-billing) is available to all sites at all plan levels. When you switch to annual billing, you save compared to the monthly cost. Sites on monthly plans switching to annual billing (without changing plan size) are invoiced immediately.
