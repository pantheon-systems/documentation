When you become a site owner, you receive administrator permissions to manage the billing information, team members, and site settings.

## Administrative Tasks

### How to Add Team Members

In the Team modal, enter the email address of the user, and click **Add Team Member**.

Once the user has been added to the project, they will receive a welcome email notifying them that they are now a member of the site's team. This will allow them to access the site's codebase, create backups, mark the site as private, clear your sites' caches, sync content, and perform updates.

### How to Remove Team Members

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

All users can be removed except the site owner.

See the [Remove a Site Owner](/access-management/#remove-a-site-owner) section of our Access Management doc for more information.

</Alert>

In the Team modal, click the X next to the user you want to delete.

When you delete a user from a site, they lose the ability to perform any operations on that site.

For more information on managing teams, see the [Team Management article](/team-management).

### How to Add a Supporting Agency to Your Site

One of the best things about Pantheon is the ability to collaborate with agencies and shops on web projects. If you have contracted with a [Pantheon Partner Agency](https://pantheon.io/plans/partner-program?docs), you can add them to the site as a Supporting Organization, which will give their company access to help build, launch, or maintain your site:

## Add-ons Available for Pantheon Sites

 - [Pantheon Search](/solr) is a Solr-based system for indexing and searching site content. Pantheon provides Apache Solr v3.6 as a service for most plans including the Sandbox site plan.
 - [Object Cache](/object-cache) is a Redis-based open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store that can be used as a drop-in caching backend for your Drupal or WordPress website.

Pantheon also offers [New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring](/new-relic) to our customers, built into the Site Dashboard. New Relic offers a wide array of metrics that provide a nearly real-time look into the performance of a web application.

### How to Enable Add-ons

From the Site Dashboard, click **Settings**, then click **Add Ons**. You will see all the available add-ons for your site.

You can access New Relic&reg; Performance Monitoring directly from the Site Dashboard, by clicking on **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-eye-open"></span> New Relic**.

### Add-ons and the Basic Plan

Pantheon Search and Object Cache are available to Sandbox plans for testings, and to Performance Small plans and higher for production sites. If either feature is enabled on your site, the feature will stop functioning and may cause errors if the site is moved to a Basic plan.

For more information about the Basic plan, see [Manage Plans in the Site Dashboard](/site-plan/#basic-plan), or see our [Site Plan FAQ](/site-plans-faq#plan-resources) to learn more about plan resources.

## Billing Tasks

## Recover an Account After a Site Owner Leaves

See the steps in our [Site Access](/site-access) doc for recovery instructions.

### Change Site Service Level

From the Site Dashboard, click the tag that shows the current plan or **Upgrade** next to the site's name. Select a plan, and follow the prompts to pay or transfer site ownership to invite another user to pay.

For more information, see [Manage Plans in the Site Dashboard](/site-plan).

### Change or Update Payment Method

### Change Site Billing Frequency from Monthly to Annual

Self-serve sites are billable via recurring monthly or [annual](/annual-billing) billing. Sites that are owned by a Reseller, Edu+, or Enterprise organization are invoiced to the organization.

### Can I transfer ownership of a site to someone else?
