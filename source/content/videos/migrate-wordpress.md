<Youtube src="ksg1XkH1da8" title="Migrate to Pantheon" />

Pantheon has a guided path for migrating sites onto our platform. This method gets most sites on board. Let’s click on the Migrate Existing Site button to start the process.

We give our new destination-site on Pantheon a name. And we install and activate the migration plugin on our legacy site, as instructed.

It takes a few minutes as it migrates code, database, and files. But then it’s done. That’s it—migrated!


We give you a guided path for most sites. If you can’t get your site on the platform, let us know so we can help you.
