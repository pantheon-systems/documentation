It can be overwhelming to switch to a new platform like Pantheon. There's a ton of documentation. Do you have to read it all? Can you just try it out? Yes, you can! And after getting the TL;DR version of making a new site, you should be ready to jump in too. Read more about creating a free sandbox site here: https://docs.pantheon.io/add-site-dashboard

Wow, there's a lot of detail in this section of Pantheon's documentation. But the TL;DR is pretty simple. Your websites go in a workspace. Then, you give people access either at the level of the whole workspace (and therefore all sites within it) or you're granting access to individual sites.

##  Updating DNS to Connect a Domain Name to Pantheon - the TL;DR Version



Updating DNS can be scary. Depending on your team, the importance of your site, and the complexity of your site, all this preparation for going live might be a huge and long effort. Or maybe you just need some clear docs specific to your registrar. That's what this doc walks you through.

Website operations get more efficient with automation. TL;DR, Pantheon's hook system for building out automation is called Quicksilver. If you want to run scripts in response to each deployment or each creation of a Multidev environment, you declare that in your pantheon.yml file. Now you're automatically posting to Slack so that your co-workers stay in the loop with each deployment. That's what this doc explains.

Using the command line in general can be intimidating. Tools like Pantheon's CLI, Terminus, are more approachable when you know they're mostly just an alternative way to do all the things you might do in the browser-based dashboard. And on the command line, you get the option of building custom Bash scripts if that's your part of your process. To get more than the TL;DR read about Terminus here.
