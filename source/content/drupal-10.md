## Update a Drupal 9 Site to Drupal 10

1. Confirm that the site uses PHP 8.1 or higher:

   Go to the [Site Dashboard](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#site-dashboard) and click **Settings**, and then click **PHP version**. The PHP 8.1+ update will show as available to install if you are not already on it.

   If you are not on PHP 8.1 and you don't see the update, refer to [Upgrade PHP Versions](/guides/php/php-versions) for instructions on updating your PHP version.

1. Run [Drupal's Upgrade Status](https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status).

1. Use [Composer to update](/upgrade-drupal-with-ic-to-latest#set-drupal-core-version) to Drupal 10. Refer to the [Drupal release-specific documentation](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases) for more information.

   Composer will prompt you to add `phpstan/extension-installer` to your `allow-plugins` config if you haven't done so already.

## Create a Drupal 10 Site

This process requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) version 2.2 and uses Pantheon's current [PHP version](/guides/php#supported-php-versions).

1. Create a new Drupal site using the ["Drupal with Composer" CMS/Start State](/add-site/) documentation.

1. [Clone the site](/guides/git/git-config#clone-your-site-codebase) locally with Git.

   - The cloned site contains a pre-configured `composer.json` file. No additional configuration is needed for the site to work on Pantheon.

1. Review the documentation to [install and configure Git](/guides/git/git-config) correctly before you begin developing your site on Pantheon.
