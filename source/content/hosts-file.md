The `hosts` file exists on all major operating systems. It's a list of IP addresses and domains that takes precedence over DNS assigned values. You can modify your `hosts` file to test domain-specific settings leading up to a migration, before DNS records have been updated, or to help with [local development](/local-development).

## Configure Your Hosts File with a Local Alias to Your Pantheon Environment

1. Use `dig` to get the IP address of your Pantheon environment to use in your `hosts` file. Replace `dev-example.pantheonsite.io` with your site's domain:

 ```bash{outputLines:2}
 dig +short dev-example.pantheonsite.io
 203.0.113.42
 ```

1. Edit the `hosts` file as shown below to map the result to an alias for easier local development:

 ```none
 203.0.113.42    dev-example
 ```
