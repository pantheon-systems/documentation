The [docroot](/nested-docroot#enable-nested-docroot) is the directory from which your site is served. On Pantheon, this defaults to the root directory of the site's codebase (`code`). Specifying `web_docroot: true` in your [pantheon.yml](/pantheon-yml/#nested-docroot) file or in the [pantheon.upstream.yml](/pantheon-yml/#custom-upstream-configurations) file in your upstream allows you to serve site files from the `web` subdirectory of your site's code repository on all Pantheon environments (for example `code/web`).

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">


Using Pantheon's one-click Dashboard updates feature depends on a correctly set the `web_docroot` property.

- Composer-managed sites, including [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) sites, require you to set the `web_docroot` property in the `pantheon.upstream.yml` file.
- Sites that use a [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream) require you to set the `web_docroot` property in the `pantheon.upstream.yml` file.
- Sites that do not use Composer and do not use a Custom Upstream should not set the `web_docroot` property, if one-click Dashboard updates are desired.

</Alert>

## Advantages and Use Cases

While URLs are limited to the web docroot, PHP is not. Using a nested docroot allows you to put PHP files for use in your web application one level above the web docroot so they are accessible via PHP but not from the web.

This is especially useful for third party dependencies, such as those installed and managed via [Composer](/guides/composer).

## Disable One-click Updates

If you wish to stop using one-click updates in the dashboard on a particular Drupal 6/7 or WordPress site, and instead intend to update your site with Composer in a nested docroot,  switch the site's upstream to an empty repository using [Terminus](/terminus). Newer supported versions of Drupal are Composer-managed by default.

## Enable Nested Docroot

Enable nested docroot by adjusting your site's `pantheon.yml` file. Below we recommend using Git, but you can also use SFTP to set up your site.

1. Set the Dev environment's connection mode to Git from within the Site Dashboard or via [Terminus](/terminus):

 ```bash{promptUser: user}
 terminus connection:set <site>.<env> git
 ```

1. [Clone the site's codebase](/guides/git/git-config#clone-your-site-codebase), if you haven't already.
1. Create a `pantheon.yml` file if it doesn't already exist.
1. Add the line `web_docroot: true` to the top level of the YAML file, typically after `api_version`. For example:

  ```yml
    api_version: 1

    web_docroot: true
  ```

1. Add, commit, and push the `pantheon.yml` file using Git.
1. Follow the instructions in either [Create a New Site with a Nested Docroot](#create-a-new-site) or [Convert an Existing Site to Use a Nested Docroot](#convert-an-existing-site) below.

### Create a New Site

Your site should use a [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream) with a `pantheon.upstream.yml` file that enables nested docroot and the CMS code is in a web subdirectory. If not, create a new site using the steps below.

### Convert an Existing Site

You'll need to move the CMS code into the `web` subdirectory, either manually or by using one of the commands below.

The command below uses `find` to select all files at the document root, including "dot" files, but skips all directories and all files explicitly excluded in the `egrep` section. It then lists the specific core directories to move into the nested docroot. This may or may not produce the correct results, depending on what files you or your team has added. You can add files to be excluded in the list after `egrep`, and use the `-n` flag for `git mv` to perform a dry run first.

[Clone the site's codebase](/guides/git/git-config#clone-your-site-codebase), then execute the following from the project root directory:

```bash{promptUser: user}
mkdir web
git mv -k $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | egrep -v 'pantheon.yml|.gitignore|README.md|pantheon.upstream.yml') includes/ misc/ modules/ profiles/ scripts/ sites/ themes/ index.php web
```

These commands create the `web` subdirectory, then use Git to move required files into the nested docroot.

Your directory structure should look like this afterwards:

```none
├── web
  ├── includes
  ├── index.php
  ├── misc
  ├── modules
  ├── profiles
  ├── scripts
  ├── sites
      └── all
          ├── modules
          └── themes
          └── default
          └── settings.php
  └── themes
```

```

Your directory structure should look like this afterwards:

```none

  ├── index.php
  ├── wp-activate.php
  ├── wp-config.php
  ├── wp-config-local-sample.php
  ├── wp-config-pantheon.php

  ├── wp-content
    ├── index.php
    ├── mu-plugins
    ├── themes
    ├── plugins
```

After using one of these commands, verify the new file locations with `git status` before committing and pushing.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

### Quicksilver Script Location

If you are using a Quicksilver platform hook with the type `webphp`, make sure that the path to the script is relative to the `web` docroot and not the project root.

For example, if your `pantheon.yml` has a script location definition of `private/scripts/my_quicksilver_script.php`, the file needs to be located at `web/private/scripts/my_quicksilver_script.php`. This is because `webphp` scripts are run with Nginx, which is serving from the nested docroot.

### Can I specify a subdirectory other than web?

The directory name is not configurable, but you can [create a symlink](/symlinks-assumed-write-access#create-a-symbolic-link) from some other directory to `web`.
