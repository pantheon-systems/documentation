<dfn id="change">Change Management</dfn> is an [Organization](/organizations) feature that enables role-based permissions for users in the organization. It is automatically enabled for all Organizations.

Users added to the organization can access all sites associated with the organization, with access restricted based on the user's role in that organization. These roles exist to restrict who can deploy code on sites, and manage other users in the organization or sites it works on.

## Roles and Permissions

These tables detail the actions each role can execute on each Dashboard.

In some Dashboards, you may notice the "User in Charge" label applied to a user. This helps distinguish who created a site for Enterprise and EDU Organizations where members are allowed to spin up new Sandbox sites at will. However, in these organizations the "User in Charge"  cannot adjust the site service level — e.g. to take a site live. Because this may affect the overall bill for the organization, only organization admins are allowed to change service levels.

If you are an administrator for a Pantheon organization, [contact support](/guides/support/contact-support/) to have the User in Charge changed.

 ![The Organization dashboard, site tab](../images/dashboard/organization-dashboard-sites.png)

An email confirmation is sent to the user. Users with an existing Pantheon account are immediately added to the Organization. Users without existing accounts must first click the confirmation link in the email to create their account.

1. Click **Operations**, and choose **Change Role**.

1. Select the new role from the drop-down > click **Set User Role**.

To change the owner of a paid site (e.g. Basic or Performance):

<Partial file="transfer-ownership-billing-steps.md" />

Keep in mind that [Partner Organizations cannot own sites directly](/organizations/#organization-site-association).

For Sandbox sites, within the Team modal, the current site owner can click **Make Owner** next to the site team member who should receive ownership of the site.

## Manage a Site's Team

### Add a User to a Site

1. Click **Team** in the Site Dashboard.

1. Enter the user's email address > select a role > click **Add Team Member**.

### Add a Supporting Organization to a Site

Organization Administrators, Users in Charge, or Site Owners can add a [Supporting Organization](/organizations#organization-site-association).

1. Click **Team** in the Site Dashboard.

1. Click **Add a Supporting Organization** > enter the organization's name in the search box > click **Search**.

1. Select a role > click **Add**.

All members of the Supporting Organization receive the role assigned on the site, regardless of their role in the Supporting Organization.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### Which role should I assign a user to give them the lowest level of access?

At the site level, the Developer role has the least amount of permissions and can create sites, view the Organization Dashboard, and deploy to the Development and Multidev environments. At the organization level, the Unprivileged role has the least amount of permissions and can only create sites.

#### Which environments can a user with the Developer role deploy to?

The Developer role can only deploy to Development and Multidev environments. If a user needs to deploy to Live, you can promote a Developer to Team Member for a single site by adding the user to the site's team.

#### Who can add users to Organizations?

Enterprise Administrators can add site Team Members or Supporting Organizations to **sites** owned by the organization, with the Developer or organizational Team Member roles. Partner Organizations can assign users the role of an Administrator, Team Member, or Developer at the organization level.

#### How do I recover an account after a site owner leaves?

See the steps in our [Site Access](/site-access) doc for recovery instructions.
