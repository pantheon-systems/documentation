<!-- Note to authors: this is early access content. When the feature goes to general access, this content should likely be added to the Terminus guide - or at least, the terminus commands should be, and an entry to the plugins page.

<Alert title="Early Access" type="info" icon="leaf">

Customer scheduled cron jobs are available for [Early Access](/guides/support/early-access/) participants.

While this feature is in Early Access, Pantheon's development team releases new functionality often. Please review Pantheon's [Software Evaluation Licensing Terms](https://legal.pantheon.io/#contract-hkqlbwpxo) for more information about support expectations for and access to Pantheon's pre-release software.

</Alert>

The [Terminus](/terminus-overview) Scheduled Jobs Plugin allows customers to schedule and automate specific cron jobs according to their requirements. You can specify the desired frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, hourly), and the actions to be performed. The system then executes the scheduled jobs automatically based on the provided instructions.

## Requirements

- [Terminus](/terminus/install)

## Installation

To install this plugin, run the following:

```bash
terminus self:plugin:install pantheon-systems/terminus-scheduled-jobs-plugin
```

For more information about installing Terminus Plugins, see [Install Plugins](/terminus/plugins) in our Terminus Guide.

## Usage

The plugin uses the following syntax:

```bash
terminus scheduledjobs:<command>:<subcommand> <site>.<env> "<job name>" "<cron command>" "<cron schedule>"
```

Where:

- `<command>:<subcommand>`: the Scheduled Jobs Plugin command and subcommand. See the [Commands](/customer-scheduled-cron-jobs#commands) section for details.

- `<site>.<env>`: the site name or UUID.  Use `terminus site:list` to retrieve a list of site names and UUIDs.

- `<job name>`: a brief description of the job.

- `<cron command>`: the cron command you are scheduling. The following commands cannot be used:
  - Outbound email via `sendmail` or `localhost` SMTP is not permitted. Email can still be sent via integrations with third party email providers either via their SMTP servers or API integrations.
  - New Relic

- `<cron schedule>`: the schedule for the job.  See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for more information about cron schedules.

### Jobs "Budget"

Each site has a fixed allocated budget of 300 minutes per day. This is calculated as the sum of all job durations, from the moment the job has started until it finished. 

There are currently no restrictions around the number of schedules that can be created for any given site. If the daily budget is exhausted, running jobs are given a 15 minute grace period after which a timeout signal will be issued. No other jobs will be created that day until midnight UTC when all budgets are reset. In calculating the budget, partial minutes are rounded up.

### Job Timeouts

Timeouts are dynamic and dependent on the remaining budget plus the 15 minute grace period. For instance, the daily available budget at the start of the day is 300 minutes, which means the first job's timeout is 315 minutes. When a job is launched throughout the day and the remaining budget is 60 minutes, the timeout will be calculated to 75 minutes.

## Commands

These commands may require the following variables, indicated by `<variable name>`. 

- `<site>.<env>`: the site name or UUID.  Use `terminus site:list` to retrieve a list of site names and UUIDs.

- `<job name>`: a brief description of the job.

- `<cron command>`: the cron command you are scheduling. The following commands cannot be used:

- `<cron schedule>`: the schedule for the job.  See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for more information about cron schedules.

- `<job ID>`: The unique ID of the job, which you can find using the [`jobs:list`](/customer-scheduled-cron-jobs#list) command.

- `<schedule ID>`: the unique ID of the schedule, which you can find using the [`schedule:list`](/customer-scheduled-cron-jobs#schedulelist) command.
