Pantheon for EDU+ allows Organization Administrators to manage who can change service level [plans](https://pantheon.io/pricing) for sites within their [organization](/docs/organizations/). When a site is not associated with an organization, you can add a credit card to change the site's plan. When a site is associated with an EDU+ Organization, billing is managed through a contract with Pantheon, and only Organization Administrators can change a site's plan.

If you have a free Pantheon for EDU account and would like to upgrade to Pantheon for EDU+, [complete this form](https://pantheon.io/pantheon-edu-plus) to contact our Sales team.

## Specify Take Live/Payment Instructions
From the Organization Dashboard, go to **Settings** and enter a **Take Live/Payment Instructions URL** and a **Service Level Change Instructions URL** to be shown to users who are not Organization Administrators in the site's settings.

These settings allow a payment flow so your EDU+ Organization can collect information needed to take the site live, manage accounting, and chargebacks to the appropriate department or unit within your organization.

The URL includes information that you can use to auto-populate a form you control. For example:
```
https://www.awesome.edu/technology/web/payment-form?site_name=my-site&id=6b23f58b-132b-4547-93bd-71bb34fc0b1d&service_level=free&owner=Jane%Smith&email=jane%40awesome.edu
```

This allows you to collect the site name, site UUID, site owner, and site owner's email address. You may also want to collect an accounting number, desired plan, technical contact name and email address, domain names, desired go live date, and additional comments.
