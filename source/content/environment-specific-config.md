In order to improve the development and debugging processes, you might use settings and plugins in your Development environment that you do not use on Live.

This doc shows how to use the same codebase with different settings for each environment, using values for the [PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT variable](/read-environment-config). To quickly see which environment you are on, consider installing the [Pantheon HUD plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pantheon-hud/).

## Define WP_DEBUG to Perform Actions Based on Environment

To conditionally set `WP_DEBUG` based on the given Pantheon environment, change the [existing code block](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/blob/default/wp-config.php#L72-L74) defining it. This example configuration enables `WP_DEBUG` for development environments (Dev and Multidevs), while disabling it on production environments (Test and Live):

```php:title=wp-config.php
/**
 * WordPress debugging mode.
 *
 * Sets WP_DEBUG to true on if on a development environment.
 *
 */

if (!defined('WP_DEBUG') && isset($_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
    define( 'WP_DEBUG', !in_array( $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'], ['test', 'live']) );
}
```

For more options when editing `wp-config.php` for debugging, see [Configure Error Logging](https://wordpress.org/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/#configure-error-logging) in the WordPress documentation.

## Configuration in an mu-plugin

Filters or functions running in an mu-plugin can enable development plugins that should be active in Dev and/or Test, but disabled in Live. To achieve this, use an mu-plugin that checks which environment you're on, and then activates or deactivates plugins that were deactivated or activated when the database clone completed.

### Use the WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE Function to Define the Environment for a Plugin

<Partial file="wp_get_environment_type.md" />

### Create the Plugin

Copy this plugin file to `wp-content/mu-plugins/site-config.php` and edit accordingly.

 ```php:title=site-config.php
<?php
/*
  Plugin Name: Site Config
  Plugin URI: https://pantheon.io/docs/environment-specific-config
  Description: Activates and deactivates plugins based on environment.
  Version: 0.1.1
  Author: Pantheon
  Author URI: https://pantheon.io/docs/contributors
*/
# Ensuring that this is on Pantheon
if ( isset( $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'] ) ) :

# Symlink to the env-configs file
require_once( 'site-config/live-specific-configs.php' );

endif;
```

### Add Configuration

Create a new directory, `wp-content/mu-plugins/site-config/`, and add a `live-specific-configs.php` file. This example activates the `wp-reroute-email` and `debug-bar` plugins, and sets the Jetpack plugin's development mode on all environments except for Live. It also adds the converse filters and deactivates the plugins on Live. You can expand this file to account for all of your environment-specific configurations, or add similar files for Dev-specific and Test and Live-specific configurations.

 ```php:title=live-specific-configs.php
<?php

# List Development Plugins
    $plugins = array(
        'debug-bar/debug-bar.php',
        'developer/developer.php',
        'wp-reroute-email/wp-reroute-email.php'
        );

# Live-specific configs
    if ( in_array( $_ENV['PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT'], array( 'live' ) ) ) {

    # Disable Development Plugins
        require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/plugin.php');
        foreach ($plugins as $plugin) {
            if(is_plugin_active($plugin)) {
	            deactivate_plugins($plugin);
            }
        }

    # Disable jetpack_development_mode
        add_filter( 'jetpack_development_mode', '__return_false' );
    }

    # Configs for All environments but Live
    else {

   	# Activate Development Plugins

        require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/plugin.php');
        foreach ($plugins as $plugin) {
            if(is_plugin_inactive($plugin)) {
                activate_plugin($plugin);
            }
        }

    # Enable development mode for jetpack
        add_filter( 'jetpack_development_mode', '__return_true' );
}

```

The next time you deploy code from Dev to Test and clone the database from Live into Test, the plugins will remain active on Test, even though the database clone would normally deactivate them. This is especially important for plugins like [wp-reroute-email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-reroute-email/), which prevents Test and Dev environments from behaving like Live, in this case, spamming emails to users.

Using the above example will prevent you from ever changing the named options. If you want to be able to change them, consider setting and checking for a transient, as Devin does in [Programmatically Update Settings in Staging](https://wptheming.com/2015/08/programmatically-update-staging-settings/).

Plugins with development-specific filters can be enabled in Dev for development without unwanted production-like behavior. In the example above, we've activated Jetpack's [development mode filter](https://jetpack.com/support/development-mode/) everywhere except for Live. This allows developers to build and test with Jetpack, without connecting Dev and Test environments to WordPress.com.

The [Developer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developer/) plugin by Automattic checks whether you have recommended development plugins enabled on your site. Adding those plugins to your codebase and then adding them to the $plugins array in the example plugin will ensure this happens automatically.

## Use the pre_option to Modify Options

The [`pre_option_(option_name)`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/pre_option_(option_name)) filter is the recommended way to change options on an environment basis.

It runs after the value is pulled from the database, providing the ability to overwrite the option value before itâ€™s used by WordPress.

[`update_option()`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_option) should be avoided in this case, as the value is only being changed under specific conditions and a database write of the new value is not required.
