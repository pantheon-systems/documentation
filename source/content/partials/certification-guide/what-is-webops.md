Websites, like other software ecosystems, need to take the following factors into account:

* Competing needs of different groups of **people**
* Incongruent **processes** preferred by those groups
* Approaches to **platform** technology

If you've worked in software in recent years, you're likely familiar with the term "DevOps" and how it addresses this set of factors. DevOps is a collection of practices and tools designed to unify and streamline the processes of software development ('Dev') and IT operations ('Ops'). The fact that DevOps has become so popular underscores a critical hurdle in contemporary software development - that successful software releases are a team sport, requiring cohesive cross-functional collaboration, and that bridging the gap between diverse teams, each with its own perspectives and objectives, and guiding them towards a shared goal, can be complex and challenging.

Put simply, WebOps seeks to apply the principles of DevOps to applications on the web, where digital marketing teams fight hard to deliver business impact through their most important channel - Digital.

**WebOps is the practice of maximizing the value of web channels by driving the velocity of change.**

WebOps requires  practices and principles for building and optimizing websites that emphasize cross-functional collaboration, automation of repeatable tasks, and a continuous iterative improvement model that lasts throughout the lifecycle of a website.

WebOps methodologies help cross-functional teams work in harmony, improving the productivity and efficiency of the entire web team, from developers and designers to content editors and marketing and IT stakeholders. By facilitating the shift from the monolithic waterfall approach that has traditionally guided website launches, to an iterative, continuous cycle of measurable improvements over time, WebOps allows the website to change with velocity as a living, breathing entity that can deliver true impact at each stage of its lifecycle.

At its core, WebOps leads teams to breaking down silos and creating a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. By automating repetitive tasks and using tools that facilitate communication and feedback, teams can work more rapidly and more efficiently by reducing the risk of errors or miscommunications. This puts marketing teams in position to respond to changing business needs, market shifts, and new user requirements in real time.

WebOps also emphasizes continuous integration and delivery, meaning that changes are tested and deployed quickly and reliably. This is achieved through the use of automated testing and deployment tools, which can help catch errors early in the development process and reduce the risk of downtime or other issues.

For Open Source developers, WebOps is especially important because it provides a framework for managing the entire web development process, from design to deployment. Both Drupal and WordPress have lifecycles that often entail complex development requirements, cross-functional collaboration, performance and security considerations, and automated testing and deployment. By emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous integration and delivery, WebOps can help Drupal and WordPress developers work more efficiently and reduce errors.

Ultimately, WebOps sets the stage for a high-performing team dynamic, enabling cross-functional collaboration, enhancing productivity, and driving superior end results. The flexibility inherent in this approach ensures businesses can adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape.


<Alert title="Key Takeaways" type="info" >

* Successful software delivery is a collaborative effort among many different stakeholders and teams. Its success depends on how well these teams work together.
* WebOps helps teams collaborate to successfully apply the principles of DevOps to their website, which is one of the most important marketing channels for driving the business forward.
* Unlike traditional software, the website is a living, breathing entity that requires continuous feedback and improvement over time. WebOps makes this feedback loop faster and easier to navigate.
