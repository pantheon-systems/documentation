* List three general problems that can be solved through the implementation of WebOps.
* Describe how WebOps helps solve collaboration bottlenecks between Marketing, Developers, and IT.

WebOps addresses common points of friction that slow teams down, such as collaboration bottlenecks, code regressions, content freezes, and application maintenance. It allows cross-functional web teams to be agile, emulating the approach used by the best software-engineering and product-development teams to create successful products. Agility is what enables companies to consistently outpace the competition. Agile teams move faster and more efficiently, which is how they deliver results.

### Collaboration Bottlenecks: Who Owns the Website?

Marketing, IT, and Developers can all lay claim to ownership of the website. [According to a survey of over 400 Marketing and IT leaders conducted by Hanover Research](https://pantheon.io/resources/ebooks/bridge-divide-between-marketing-and-it), there is a lack of consensus over who owns the site: 84% of Marketing leaders claimed to own their organization’s website, while 87% of IT leaders also claimed to own their organization’s site. Add to this impasse the Developers and Designers often caught in the middle. No website gets made without them!

In reality, the success of the website comes down to how well these three teams collaborate. When collaboration bottlenecks occur, progress on the website stalls out, and the business loses.


### Pressure on Marketers: Pace of Change

While all roles involved in a website can feel the pressure to go faster, this pressure is often felt most acutely by marketers held accountable for business results. Sites visitor expectations are always changing. A feature delivered late for yesterday's expectations might not be as valuable tomorrow.

That is why many web teams find success when a leader from the Marketing department acts as the Product Owner of the website.

The website is a digital product after all. It helps to have one person driving the strategy who is measured on how well that strategy is executed.

Marketing teams are usually responsible for the results of the website, which are commonly known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s). [Some of the most common KPI’s used to measure the success of a marketing website include](https://pantheon.io/blog/stop-sprinting-circles-find-your-north-star):

* **E-commerce revenue:** A site that is a point of sale will likely use revenue as the North Star. This is ultimately how you will prioritize your efforts and measure the impact.
* **Ad impressions or ad revenue:** If you're running a media property, your North Star is going to be adjacent to revenue. You'll want to pick a metric of traffic or user engagement.
* **Lead generation:** Lots of websites in a B2B business context are marketing tools whose obvious goal is to create pipeline for a business; they should focus on conversion rates and overall volume of leads. Many advocacy or campaign sites also fit this mold.
* **Unique users:** A website that exists to broadly communicate a message should be oriented around a total quantity of unique users as a way to measure how broadly its reach is being felt.
* **Daily active users: **A website that exists to engage a core audience (e.g. a community forum) should prioritize daily (or weekly) active users.

Leveraging their deep understanding of customer behavior, market trends, and business objectives, Marketers map out the strategic vision for the website. This includes defining the user journey, required functionality, and the overall look and feel of the site, to effectively communicate the brand message and drive customer engagement.

Marketing is responsible for capturing leads, even as conditions evolve, and they must be able to run experiments to optimize their approach over time. Ideally, this requires the ability to make changes at any time without having to go around other teams (such as IT). However, Marketing usually relies on developers, with their technical prowess, to implement the changes needed to bring their vision to reality.

Developers possess a unique skill set that allows them to work with code to create magical experiences for visitors to the website. Developers create the site's architecture, write the code, integrate necessary plugins or modules, and ensure the site's performance and security. Without their talent, Marketing would be unable to execute on the strategy that will help them achieve their KPIs.

Developers are autonomous and do not require help from Marketing to write code, but they must adhere to the strategic vision set out by the Marketing team by converting those high level ideas into detailed technical tasks. They break down the strategy into individual components such as feature development, design changes, plugin integrations, and performance enhancements. And they often utilize an Agile approach, breaking the tasks up into iterative development cycles, or sprints, which typically last one or two weeks.

Effective collaboration between Marketing and Developers requires a tight feedback loop between the two groups. If Marketing has an idea that needs to be implemented “yesterday”, the Developers must be able to quickly shift focus toward the prioritized work, and temporarily away from what they might be working on that is less pressing. The sooner Developers are able to solicit feedback from the Marketing team, the less likely they are to waste effort and elongate the timeline by going too far down a path that misses the mark. 

A WebOps platform can shorten that feedback loop by providing the tools, workflows, and guardrails to ensure that each team can be in the best position to deliver and respond to feedback, ensuring that the Developers’ efforts are hitting the mark defined by Marketing at each step of the way.
