* Explain some of the extra tasks a developer is typically expected to perform, beyond simply writing code.
* Describe how putting WebOps guardrails in place ahead of time helps Developers be more productive and work more efficiently.

</Alert>

Developers often feel caught in the middle. On one side, they have the Product Owner always asking for more to be done faster. On the other side, they know IT leaders are willing to slow down to stay safe. Navigating these competing pressures, staying on the critical path can feel like a puzzle.

That's OK. Developers tend to like puzzles.

Developers thrive on solving complex problems by breaking down business requirements, tasks and functions into discrete parts that work interchangeably with other parts. Their work requires deep focus, pinpoint attention to detail, a great deal of patience, as well as creativity and a collaborative spirit. 

As web applications have become more complex over time, however, being a developer has often meant taking on additional tasks that can distract them from the critical path that gets quality code out the door.

Some examples of the additional tasks that pull focus for Developers are:

* **Setting up and maintaining a local development environment:** This process often involves installing and configuring various software and tools, which can be time-consuming and complex.
* **Managing infrastructure:** Developers are sometimes tasked with ensuring that servers, storage, networks, and other systems are properly set up and functioning optimally.
* **Ensuring server uptime:** It's essential to keep websites accessible and performing well, which can involve monitoring servers, managing traffic loads, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
* **Handling site maintenance:** Regular updates, backups, and troubleshooting are needed to keep a website running smoothly.
* **Deploying code to production servers:** This task involves moving code from a testing or staging environment to a live server where it's accessible to users. This process can be tricky and, if not done correctly, can lead to service disruptions.
* **Database management:** Developers often have to backup and restore databases, as well as ensure their security and performance.
* **Troubleshooting performance issues:** Developers may need to review server logs, monitor system resources, and use other tools to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
* **Securing websites: **This involves implementing security measures, staying up-to-date with the latest security patches, and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.



It’s easy to see where the lines can be blurred between what Developers are concerned with and what IT is concerned with. At the end of the day, though, Developers are the ones who are on the hook for delivering the digital product owned by Marketing and secured by IT. With real deadlines and deliverables, Developers do not have the luxury of working around these extraneous tasks and systems in order to simply write code. They must deal with whatever is in their way and causing friction. And for this reason, the only way to optimize a Developer’s time and maximize their job satisfaction is to remove as much of the friction-causing concerns as possible.

That's where you need a  WebOps platform!

An effective WebOps platform can simplify a Developer’s job and allow them to focus on their primary work of writing code and deploying wonderful features. By packaging up environmental dependencies into a portable, containerized environment, WebOps makes it simple and straightforward to set up a local development environment where the Developer can be productive wherever and whenever they prefer - on the couch, in the early hours of the morning, on an airplane, or on the beach. A WebOps platform can securely wrap features into a pushbutton format, where tasks like spinning up a new, non-production, environment for developing and testing features, backing up the database and files to prevent data loss, versioning code to preserve the ability to roll back unwanted changes, and kicking off a Continuous Deployment pipeline can be done simply and without risk. 

And when that WebOps platform is also part of an enterprise-grade, scalable, secure and performant web hosting environment, Developers no longer have to weigh concerns around infrastructure maintenance, server uptime, or cloud security. In other words, a WebOps platform removes most of the friction that prevents Developers from being as efficient and productive as they can be. And we believe this can make their jobs more collaborative, less stressful, and ultimately more fulfilling.
