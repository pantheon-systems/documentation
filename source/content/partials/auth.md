## Authenticating

### SSH Keys

Pantheon does not provide access to a shell environment over SSH. These directions allow you to have passwordless access if you configure Git, SFTP, or Drush to use SSH keys.

You should load your public SSH key into your account to take full advantage of Pantheon. SSH keys are a best practice for authentication, allowing you more security than a simple password. You only have to configure this once, no matter how many sites you work on. Refer to [Generate and Add SSH Keys](/ssh-keys) for more information.
