## Authenticating

### SSH Keys

Pantheon does not provide access to a shell environment over SSH. These directions allow you to authenticate operations on Pantheon like  Git, SFTP, WP-CLI or Drush via SSH keys.

You should load your public SSH key into your account to take full advantage of Pantheon. SSH keys are required in order to interact with remote Pantheon environments. You only have to configure this once, no matter how many sites you work on. Refer to [Generate and Add SSH Keys](/ssh-keys) for more information.
