Load tests provide critical insight into how a site will perform when released, including peak traffic spikes. Load tests ensure that your website launches smoothly and can sustain high traffic.

Using proprietary tools developed by the Pantheon Onboarding team, we generate traffic to your Live site, simulating complex user interactions if needed. This is the best way to expose and identify potential performance bottlenecks before you launch your site.

Newly purchased Elite plans include a pre-launch load test. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services?docs) for more information.
