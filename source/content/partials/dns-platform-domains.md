Pantheon issues platform domains for all environments. Each environment (Dev, Test, Live, and each Multidev) is accessible via the platform domain, and matches the following patterns:

- `dev-site-name.pantheonsite.io`
- `test-site-name.pantheonsite.io`
- `live-site-name.pantheonsite.io`
- `multidev-env-site-name.pantheonsite.io`
