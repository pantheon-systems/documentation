## WordPress FAQ

### How long does the WordPress migration process take?

Most migrations are completed within two hours. The migration time depends solely on the size of your site, so be aware that it may take more or less time than estimated. We will send you an email when your migration is complete. If there are any issues with the migration, we will notify you by email.

### Are database table prefixes supported?

You must review [WordPress known issues](/wordpress-known-issues/#table-prefixes) for potential extra steps.

### How do I clone an existing Pantheon site?

You can make a copy of a WordPress site on Pantheon by following the [standard migration procedure](/migrate). The procedure does not deviate for WordPress sites already hosted on Pantheon, and is preferred since it's built into the Site Dashboard.
