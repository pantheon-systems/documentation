Pantheon uses monthly maintenance windows to perform essential updates and improvements to the platformâ€™s software and infrastructure. This hour-long window will not impact site visitors or site availability. Access to the Pantheon Dashboard and workflows may experience temporary interruptions.

## Schedule
The following schedule is used to perform monthly platform maintenance:

* **Frequency**: Monthly
* **Day**: Second Tuesday of each month
* **Time**: 6 PM to 7 PM Pacific Time
* **Duration**: 1 hour

### Communication and Support
An update on the [Status page](https://status.pantheon.io/) will be posted on the first Thursday of each month to alert you about upcoming maintenance the following Tuesday. At the same time, the Dashboard will feature a banner about the upcoming maintenance. If no maintenance is required for a given month, no status page will be posted.

When necessary, we will leverage the same window to perform maintenance that may impact live sites. In these cases, we will notify you at least 30 days before the maintenance window.  

If you have any questions during scheduled maintenance windows, please [contact support](/guides/support/contact-support/).
