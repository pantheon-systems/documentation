This guide is intended to elevate the way we communicate at Pantheon, and to support our community and contributors in using more inclusive language. It will help ensure everyone feels included and welcome by the language we use and the examples we share.

## What is Inclusive Language?

Inclusive language is [defined](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/inclusive-language) as "language that avoids the use of certain expressions or words that might be considered to exclude particular groups of people."

When using inclusive language, you are "acknowledging diversity, conveying respect to all people, being sensitive to differences, and promoting equitable opportunities." - [University of Oregon](https://communications.uoregon.edu/inclusive-language)

### What Inclusive Language Means at Pantheon

It's how we show up. At Pantheon, everyone has a responsibility to communicate and behave inclusively. It's the way we lift others up, show up for others, speak up in meetings, and consistently consider other perspectives and backgrounds.

We know inclusive language is essential in [building trust](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/03/why-inclusive-language-matters-in-tech/#336a80c96017), to [attracting talent](https://medium.com/diversity-together/70-inclusive-language-principles-that-will-make-you-a-more-successful-recruiter-part-1-79b7342a0923), and [aiding productivity](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity). But most importantly, it will help us grow a diverse company where inclusivity is the very fabric of how we act, speak, feel, and think.

## Who This Is For

This guide is shared internally to help teams communicate with other teams, and externally to parties writing for our Docs pages, Blog, or on our forum.

### Who Benefits

This will help drive inclusivity in the way we communicate to everyone, including Pantheon employees, our customers, our prospects, people in our communities, and those learning about us in the news or on our blog.

### Applicable Content

This applies to absolutely everything. Consider inclusive language in the product, presentation decks, job ads, social media, documentation, blog posts, landing pages on our website, and the way we communicate in emails and in meetings.

### What is racial language? 

Racial language is derogatory to people due to their ethnicity, race, or skin color. These terms, slurs, and stereotypes contributed to decades of prejudice, discrimination, and violence. ([source](https://online.rider.edu/online-bachelors-degrees/liberal-studies/guide-to-using-inclusive-language/), in part) 

#### Examples & Alternatives:

TODO: [Tara enter definitions / alternatives]

At Pantheon, we have standardized on:

- `Allowlist`/`blocklist` rather than `whitelist`/`blacklist`
- `main` rather than `master` for branch naming conventions

Engineering work is ongoing to correct these naming conventions.
