Terminus is a command line interface that provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do almost everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, as well as scripting and much more.

## Terminus Features

Terminus is a powerful tool that allows you to:

- Create a new site
- Create and delete Multidev environments
- Clone one environment to another
- Check for and apply upstream updates
- Deploy code from one environment to another
- Run [Drush](/guides/drush/) and [WP-CLI](/guides/wp-cli/) commands
- Perform [other operations](/terminus/commands/)

## Contribute to Terminus
