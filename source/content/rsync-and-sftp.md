title: rsync and SFTP
description: Transfer large files using an SFTP client or rsync using Drupal 6, Drupal 7, or WordPress for Pantheon.

If you have more than 500 MB of content to be transferred to your `/files` directory (`sites/default/files` for Drupal and `wp-content/uploads` for WordPress), you won't be able to use your Pantheon Dashboard to import. Instead, you'll need to use a SFTP client or rsync to transfer.

This allows you to transfer unlimited data "server-to-server", which is much faster than transferring from your workstation. Files can be transferred to and from any Pantheon site environment (Dev, Test, and Live).

There are two mechanisms for transferring files: SFTP and rsync.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

You will not be able to use SFTP or rsync to add any file or directory listed in a `.gitignore` file to your Git repository. Any file uploaded in this way cannot be committed and will not be available for deployment.

## SFTP

There are a number of GUI SFTP clients available, such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org), [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). In your SFTP client, be sure to limit the number of simultaneous connections to one.

[Connection information](/docs/sftp#sftp-connection-information) for SFTP is available in each site environment. From your Pantheon Dashboard, click **Connection Info** to see your credentials.

Here's an example of using a command-line SFTP client to connect to a site environment's file directory.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

You must replace `[env]` with the target environment and `[uuid]` with the [Site UUID](/docs/sites#site-uuid) to connect. The values are case sensitive and should be lower case (e.g., dev, test, live).

</Alert>

```sftp
export ENV=[env]
# Usually dev, test, or live
export SITE=[uuid]
# Site UUID from dashboard URL: https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/[uuid]

sftp -oPort=2222 $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in
Connected to appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in
sftp> cd files
sftp> put [your file or files]
```

## rsync

rsync is also available, but it is a more advanced tool that requires experience with the command line.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

You must replace `[env]` with the target environment and `[uuid]` with the [Site UUID](/docs/sites#site-uuid) to connect. The values are case sensitive and should be lower case (e.g., dev, test, live).

</Alert>

```bash
export ENV=[env]
# Usually dev, test, or live
export SITE=[uuid]
# Site UUID from dashboard URL: https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/[uuid]

# To Upload/Import
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' ./files/. --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/

# To Download
rsync -rvlz --copy-unsafe-links --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/ ~/files


# -r: Recurse into subdirectories
# -v: Verbose output
# -l: copies symlinks as symlinks
# -L: transforms symlinks into files.
# -z: Compress during transfer
# --copy-unsafe-links: transforms symlinks into files when the symlink target is outside of the tree being copied
# Other rsync flags may or may not be supported
# (-a, -p, -o, -g, -D, etc are not).
```

Rsync is highly customizable. See the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to learn more.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Regardless of framework, WordPress or Drupal, your files need to be in the `/files` directory. This directory maps to `sites/default/files` for Drupal and `wp-content/uploads` for WordPress. Adjust paths as needed to include `web` (e.g., `web/wp-content/uploads`) for [sites configured to use a nested docroot](/docs/nested-docroot/).

</Alert>

## Examples

<Alert title="Exports" type="export">

The examples below use the variables `$ENV` and `$SITE`. You can replace these variables with your site UUID and environment, or set them before you begin:

```bash
export ENV=dev
export SITE=3ef6264e-51d9-43b9-a60b-6cc22c3129308as83
```

Replace the example values above with the environment you're working with and your site UUID. You can find the UUID in your Site Dashboard URL:

https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/**3ef6264e-51d9-43b9-a60b-6cc22c3129308as83**

</Alert>

### Download a Drupal Directory from Pantheon
Download the contents of the `sites/default/files` directory into a folder on your local environment in the `files` home folder:

```bash
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/sites/default/files/ ~/files
```

### Download a WordPress Directory from Pantheon
Download the contents of the `wp-content/uploads` directory into a folder on your local environment in the `files` home folder:

```bash
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/wp-content/uploads ~/files
```

### Download a Drupal File from Pantheon
Download the `sites/default/settings.php` file into a Drupal installation called _Foo_ on your local environment in a  `sites/default/files` folder:

```bash
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/sites/default/settings.php ~/Foo/sites/default
```

### Download a WordPress File from Pantheon
Download the `index.php` file into a WordPress installation called _Foo_ on your local environment in a `wp-content/uploads` folder:

```bash
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/wp-content/uploads/index.php ~/Foo/sites/wp-content/uploads
```

### Upload a Directory to Pantheon
If you need to upload the files directory from a local installation called Foo in your home directory to a Pantheon site's Test environment `sites/default/files` directory, use the following commands:

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

Always use the `temp-dir flag` when using rsync for uploads. Removing the flag will result in broken files after cloning from one environment to another.

</Alert>

```bash
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' ~/files/. --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/
```

### Upload a Single File to Pantheon
This example shows how to upload the logo.png file into a Pantheon site's theme folder.

```bash
rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' ~/Foo/sites/all/themes/foo/logo.png --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:code/sites/all/themes/foo
```

### Empty a Folder Recursively Using rsync
Since the `rm -r` command is not available over SFTP on Pantheon, an alternative way to recursively empty a folder is to use the rsync `--delete` flag. This example shows how to empty the remote folder `files/remote_folder_to_empty` (change this to match the remote directory you want to empty).

On your local machine, you must first create an empty folder with `mkdir empty_folder`. The folder can be named anything, as long as it's empty.

```bash
export ENV=env # Replace with the site envornment, usually dev, test, or live
export SITE=uuid # Replace with the site UUID, which you can find from the Site Dashboard URL or terminus site:info $sitename --field=id

rsync -rLvz --size-only --checksum --ipv4 --progress -a --delete -e 'ssh -p 2222' empty_folder/ --temp-dir=~/tmp/ $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:files/remote_folder_to_empty
```
Now you can use `rmdir` over SFTP to remove the empty directory itself.

## Known Issues

If you're uploading many files, and your Live environment has [multiple application containers](/docs/application-containers/#multiple-application-containers), upload to an environment other than Live (e.g. Dev), then use the clone operation in the Dashboard or [Terminus](/docs/terminus) to move the files to Live. Uploading a large amount of files into a multi-container Live environment may fail silently.
