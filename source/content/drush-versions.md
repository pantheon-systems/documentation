By default, Pantheon runs Drush 8 on newly created Drupal sites.

## Terminus Drush and Local Drush

[Terminus](/terminus/) makes remote Drush calls on sites without using a local installation, eliminating compatibility issues between local and remote installs. For more information, see our guide on [Managing Drupal Sites with Terminus and Drush](/guides/terminus-drupal-site-management/).

## Available Drush Versions

Pantheon currently supports Drush versions 8, 9, and 10.

Drush 8 is the preferred version of Drush to use with Drupal 8 sites that are managed by Composer. See [Drupal 8 and Composer on Pantheon Without Continuous Integration](/guides/drupal-8-composer-no-ci/) and the [Build Tools Workflow](/guides/build-tools/) for information on how to use Composer to manage Drupal sites on Pantheon.

Drush 8 should also be used for Drupal 8 sites that are not managed by Composer, or that use modules that provide additional Drush 8 commands.

## Verify Current Drush Version

Verify the current version of Drush running on Pantheon using [Terminus](/terminus/):

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus drush <site>.<env> -- status | grep "Drush version"
```

## Configure Drush Version

Before you modify a site's Drush version, remember that not all versions of Drush are compatible with all versions of Drupal. See [Available Drush Versions](#available-drush-versions) and the [requirements below](#compatibility-and-requirements).

Change a site's Drush version via the [pantheon.yml file](/pantheon-yml/):

```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
api_version: 1

drush_version: 8
```

Now your site’s Drush version is managed via `pantheon.yml`, so it’s in version control and deployed along with the rest of your code.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If the `pantheon.yml` file does not exist, create it. If a `pantheon.upstream.yml` file exists, do not edit it. It is used by the upstream updates repository and will cause a [merge conflict if modified](/core-updates#error-updating-conflict-modifydelete-pantheonupstreamyml-deleted-in-head-and-modified-in-upstreammaster-version-upstreammaster-of-pantheonupstreamyml-left-in-tree).

</Alert>

## Compatibility and Requirements

Drush 8 is compatible with Drupal 6, 7, and 8.

Always use Drush 8 with Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 sites, as Drush 9 and Drush 10 only work on Drupal 8.4 and later.

While Drush 5 and Drush 7 are available on Pantheon if needed, they are listed as [unsupported](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/#drupal-compatibility) by the Drush maintainers, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

Drush 10 is available with the [addition to your pantheon.yml file](#configure-drush-version) shown above, or for [site-local installation](#site-local-drush-usage). It requires Drupal 8 or higher, [Composer](/composer/), and PHP 7.1 or higher.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

When running Drush locally, we highly recommend running Drush version 8.3.2 or higher.

</Alert>

#### PHP Requirements

| Drush Version | Minimum PHP Version |
|:------------- |:------------------- |
| Drush 5       | PHP 5.2.0+          |
| Drush 7       | PHP 5.3.0+          |
| Drush 8       | PHP 5.4.5+          |
| Drush 9       | PHP 5.6.0+          |
| Drush 10      | PHP 7.1.+           |

See our guide on [Upgrading PHP Versions](/php-versions).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, even after updating the Drush version in `pantheon.yml`, the correct version of Drush is not called.

The Pantheon platform always prefers the site-local Drush or other local settings over the setting in `pantheon.yml`. Check for an outdated configuration file, `policy.drush.inc`, in your local `~/.drush` directory. Remove the file, or comment out its contents to resolve.

Executing Drush on the platform via a `terminus drush` command will use the version of Drush specified in `pantheon.yml`, unless a site-local version is present.

### Site-local Drush Usage

If you need to specify a minor version or a version not available on the platform, you can add a site-local installation of Drush to your repository.

In general, you will usually be better off not including a site-local Drush in your Pantheon site, as using the Pantheon-provided Drush ensures that you are using the recommended and most-tested version for the Pantheon platform. Occasionally, using a site-local Drush may be necessary in order to avoid conflicts with your site's dependencies.

Do not select any major version of Drush lower than `8.3.2`, `9.7.1`, or `10.2.0`.
