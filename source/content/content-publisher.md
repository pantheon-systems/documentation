   <Alert title="Note" type="info" >

  Content Publisher is currently in private beta. If you are interested in participating in the beta program, [request access here](https://pantheon.io/platform/content-publisher).

   </Alert>


Content Publisher allows content creators to publish their documents directly from Google Docs to their website. Content Publisher converts and stores Google Docs as Markdown, allowing the site to request content to the Content Publisher delivery API from the service in order to serve pages to its visitors through the website technology of their choice.
