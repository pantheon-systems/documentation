## Before You Begin

First, verify caching configuration to ensure anonymous caching is enabled. Then test to determine if CDN caching is working on your site:

- To enable anonymous caching within Drupal, see [Drupal Performance and Caching Settings](/drupal-cache).
- WordPress sites on Pantheon have anonymous caching enabled by default. See [WordPress Pantheon Cache Plugin Configuration](/wordpress-cache-plugin) for details.
- See [Testing Global CDN Caching](/test-global-cdn-caching) for steps to test.

If you see `Age: 0` after multiple requests, your site is not caching properly.

### Cache Related Headers

<dl>

<dt ignored>cache-control</dt>

<dd>

Determines caching behaviors for the given request, this configuration is set by WordPress and Drupal.

</dd>

<dt ignored>age</dt>

<dd>

How long the content has been stored in cache. If 0, the response was produced by WordPress or Drupal and not served from cache.

</dd>

<dt ignored>set-cookie</dt>

<dd>

Generated by WordPress or Drupal to send data back to the browser. The platform will not cache a response that contains the `set-cookie` header.

</dd>

</dl>

## Debug Caching Issues
Understand caching behavior for a given page by analyzing cache related HTTP headers from the command line with `curl`. For example:

```bash{outputLines: 2-18}
curl -I https://www.example.com
HTTP/2 200
cache-control: public, max-age=0 // highlight-line
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
server: nginx
x-pantheon-styx-hostname: styx-fe1-a-789d66bff9-tztp6
x-styx-req-id: 7f93c166-53fe-11ea-803e-b26d7703e33f
date: Tue, 08 Dec 2020 16:41:37 GMT
x-served-by: cache-mdw17348-MDW
x-cache: MISS
x-cache-hits: 0
x-timer: S1607445693.448541,VS0,VE4134
vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie
x-robots-tag: noindex
age: 0 // highlight-line
accept-ranges: bytes
via: 1.1 varnish
content-length: 41278
```

This specific example is from a Drupal site that has anonymous caching enabled, but has "none" set for expiration of cached pages within Drupal's performance settings (`/admin/config/development/performance`). For details, see [Drupal Performance and Caching Settings](/drupal-cache).

### Set-Cookie Conflicts
Pantheon's platform will not cache a response that contains the `set-cookie` header.

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

Do not use Curl to debug this scenario. Instead, investigate `set-cookie` issues and fixes from your browser, for instructions see [Test Global CDN with Browser Headers](/test-global-cdn-caching#test-global-cdn-with-browser-headers). Curl does not handle cookie data in the way that your browser does and effectively misrepresents cookie and caching behavior as a result.

</Alert>

Search for instances across the site's codebase and once isolated, edit the cookie name so that is matches the [`STYXKEY[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` naming convention](/caching-advanced-topics#using-styxkey).

Next, wrap a conditional statement around the `setcookie();` function to check whether the cookie is already defined in the request. The goal of this effort is to send `set-cookie` only on the initial request, and never on subsequent requests. For code example, see [Working with Cookies on Pantheon](/cookies#cache-varying-cookies).

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger" >

Adjusting plugin or theme code directly means this fix will need to be reapplied manually again with the next plugin or theme update. This can work well as a quick fix but often times the better solution is finding an alternative plugin or moving the related functionality to the front-end.

</Alert>

The initial request will still break through cache - that's expected, because it would not find anything defined for the cookie. Subsequent requests back to the site should find the cookie data defined in the request headers. Subsequent requests should not be sending `set-cookie` and should now be served by cache.

Again, avoid testing via curl for the `set-cookie` conflict. When it comes to cookies, Curl doesn't send the value back like your browser would so subsequent requests present as failures no matter what.

### Drupal Config Conflicts

If the `cache-control` header returns `private, must-revalidate` unexpectedly, even after enabling anonymous caching across the site, it's possible that there's a conflicting override somewhere.

- Check `settings.php` files for configuration overrides. For example, maybe there's an existing `$conf['cache']` set to `0` that should be adjusted to `1`.

- Or the conflict could be coming from a contrib module. For example, if the Domain module is in use, check performance for that particular module (e.g., `/admin/structure/domain/view/1/config`), which overrides the site performance config (`/admin/config/development/performance`).

### WordPress Sessions

PHP sessions will make your page uncacheable. It is impossible to use cached content when there are sessions in place, for example:

```bash{outputLines: 2-18}
curl -I https://www.example.com
HTTP/2 200
cache-control: public, max-age=600
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
pragma: no-cache
server: nginx
set-cookie: PHPSESSID=6c0cc28a5ff9eaff27e8f86599658b17; expires=Thu, 31-Dec-2020 23:22:24 GMT; Max-Age=2000000; path=/  // highlight-line
strict-transport-security: max-age=300
x-pantheon-styx-hostname: styx-fe1-b-5488d894d8-cbdxk
x-styx-req-id: 6d5e43b1-398e-11eb-b0a0-aeb2e6da99c3
date: Tue, 08 Dec 2020 19:49:05 GMT
x-served-by: cache-mdw17344-MDW
x-cache: MISS
x-cache-hits: 0
x-timer: S1607456945.789723,VS0,VE340
vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie
x-robots-tag: noindex
age: 0  // highlight-line
accept-ranges: bytes
via: 1.1 varnish
```

Best practice is to use a cookie based solution so that only initial requests are uncached.
