## Features

  Unlike most CDNs that only handle images and other static assets, full-page technology lets you cache entire pages and assets at the edge.
- **Layer 3 & 4 DDOS protection & mitigation**
- **SOC1 & SOC2 Compliance**
- **Origin Shielding**

  Eliminates the ability of attackers to identify IP addresses of origin servers. Value: If the attacker is able to find the IP address, they can bypass traditional CDN protection capabilities. Origin Cloaking prevents these kinds of attacks by hiding your origin from attackers.
- **IP whitelisting & blacklisting**
  - **Blacklist** - prevent users with specific IPs or in IP ranges from accessing your site.
  - **Whitelist** - only allow users with specific IPs or in IP ranges to access your site, blocking everyone else.
