## Features

- **Full-page & asset caching**

  Unlike most CDNs that only handle images and other static assets, full-page technology lets you cache entire pages and assets at the edge.
- **Layer 3 & 4 DDOS protection & mitigation**
- **SOC1 & SOC2 compliance**
- **Origin shielding**

  Eliminates the ability of attackers to identify IP addresses of origin servers. Value: If the attacker is able to find the IP address, they can bypass traditional CDN protection capabilities. Origin Cloaking prevents these kinds of attacks by hiding your origin from attackers.
- **IP whitelisting & blacklisting**
  - **Blacklist** - prevent users with specific IPs or in IP ranges from accessing your site.
  - **Whitelist** - only allow users with specific IPs or in IP ranges to access your site, blocking everyone else.
- **Token authentication / JWT (JSON Web Token)**

  Use the AGCDN Edge to generate JSON Web Tokens to help build your custom API.
- **Custom error & maintenance page rules**
- **Geolocation based edge control**

  Take action on the edge based on the physical location of the user (eg. blocking or redirecting based on country) or send back location information to your application for more custom control.
- **Device detection and edge control**
- **Persistent presence for continual uptime**

  Adjusts the 'serve stale content setting '
- **Full CDN edge logs**

  See every request to your website, whether or not the content was cached. Full CDN edge logs combine the server logs with logs from the edge to provide a complete picture of your traffic.
- **Modify headers at the edge**

  Change request and response headers before your application starts up to create, add, delete, or update parts of your request.
- **Edge Redirects**

  Reduce requests on your CMS by moving page redirects to the edge.
- **Domain masking and reverse Proxy**
  - Domain masking: run multiple Pantheon or non-Pantheon applications behind a single domain, using different URL paths
  - Reverse proxy: serve content from another service (eg. S3) seamlessly from your application.
- **Enterprise blue/green support**

### Additional Features from WAF/IO

- **Efficient image optimization (IO) at the edge**
