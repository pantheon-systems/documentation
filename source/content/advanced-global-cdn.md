## Features

- **Full-Page & Asset Caching**

  Unlike most CDNs that only handle images and other static assets, full-page technology lets you cache entire pages and assets at the edge.
- **Layer 3 & 4 DDOS protection & mitigation**
- **SOC1 & SOC2 Compliance**
- **Origin Shielding**

  Eliminates the ability of attackers to identify IP addresses of origin servers. Value: If the attacker is able to find the IP address, they can bypass traditional CDN protection capabilities. Origin Cloaking prevents these kinds of attacks by hiding your origin from attackers.
- **IP whitelisting & blacklisting**
  - **Blacklist** - prevent users with specific IPs or in IP ranges from accessing your site.
  - **Whitelist** - only allow users with specific IPs or in IP ranges to access your site, blocking everyone else.

  Use the AGCDN Edge to generate JSON Web Tokens to help build your custom API.

- **Edge Redirects**
