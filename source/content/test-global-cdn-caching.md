## Test CDN Caching with curl

1. Open a terminal.
1. Enter the following command with your full Pantheon domain URL.
    - The `-I` flag sends a HEAD request to fetch only the HTTP headers for the specified URL.
    - The `-H 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br'` flag and header forces curl to more closely simulate a typical browser request, resulting in typical cache behavior.
    - The `egrep '(HTTP|cache-control|age:)'` command limits the output to include only the relevant information.

  ```bash{outputLines: 2-7}
  curl -I -H "accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br" https://scalewp.io | egrep '(HTTP|cache-control|age:)'
    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0 14801    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
  HTTP/2 200
  cache-control: public, max-age=86400
  age: 65772
  ```

  To view the `Surrogate-Key-Raw` header, add the `Pantheon-Debug: 1` header to your request:

  ```bash{outputLines: 2-5}
  curl -Is -H "accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br" -H "Pantheon-Debug:1" https://scalewp.io | egrep '(HTTP|cache-control|age:|surrogate-key-raw)'
  HTTP/2 200
  cache-control: public, max-age=86400
  surrogate-key-raw: front post-7 post-user-6 single
  age: 71611
  ```

To see all headers, remove the pipe (`|`) and everything following it from these commands.

## Test Global CDN with Browser Headers

### View HTTPS Headers with Chrome

1. Open [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and click on the **Network** tab.
1. Load a page on your site.
1. Click on the URL of the request, under the **Name** column of the Requests table.
1. View HTTP response headers for this request on the right side of the window under the [**Headers**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#headers) tab.

### View HTTPS Headers with Firefox

1. Open the [Network Monitor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor).
1. Load a page on your site.
1. In the Network Monitor window, click on the URL of the request, under the **File** column of the Requests table.
1. View HTTP response headers for this request on the right side of the window under the [**Headers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor#Headers) tab.

### View HTTPS Headers with Internet Explorer

1. Use the developer tools by pressing **F12** or by clicking **Settings**, then **Developer Tools**.
1. Click the **Start Capturing** button to begin reading the headers from the HTTP request. If headers aren't displaying, refresh the page.

## How to Read HTTP Headers

Every HTTP response served by Pantheon is accompanied by a number of headers. These are the same headers that the CDN uses when determining if and for how long to cache content.

- **Cache-Control: public, max-age=900**
  - Set from Drupal's performance settings.
  - max-age is the number of seconds that content can remain in cache; if set to 0, content will not be cached.
  - If "no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"; this is Drupal's default header and typically indicates that there is a conflict.
  - **All static assets** (images, etc) on production environments (Test and Live) are set with a max-age of 366 days; we recommend using new file names or appending a changeable query string if content needs to change earlier. Development environments (Dev and Multidevs) intentionally do not cache static assets.

- **X-Pantheon-Styx-Hostname**
  - Hostname of the Pantheon load balancing server at the origin datacenter. There are a number of these servers, and each request may be served by a different server.

- **Server: nginx**
  - A Pantheon webserver generated the original page content. This will always be shown, even if a page is served from the a Global CDN cache.

- **X-Drupal-Cache: HIT**
  - Drupal's internal page cache served the content. See  [\_drupal\_bootstrap\_page\_cache](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21bootstrap.inc/function/_drupal_bootstrap_page_cache/7) for more information. **Drupal Only**

- **X-Generator: Drupal 7 (https://www.drupal.org/)**
  - Drupal built the page. **Drupal Only**

- **X-Served-By**
  - Hostnames of points of presence (POPs) from the Global CDN that the request routed through. The names are typically based on the codes for nearby airports. The first entry is the POP close to the origin datacenter. The second entry (if one exists) is the POP close to the device loading the page.

- **X-Cache**
  - The hit and miss values shown here correspond to the POPs listed in X-Served-By. A request can "hit" in Global CDN either close to the device loading the page or close to the origin datacenter.

- **Age: 233**
  - How long the content has been stored in cache. If 0, it was produced at the time of the request. If you see Age: 0 after multiple requests, your site is not being cached properly.

- **Via: 1.1 varnish**
  - Via is used by proxies to indicate the intermediate protocol and recipient; the request went through Varnish (which is part of the technology behind Global CDN). This header will always be shown, regardless of whether the CDN served cached content.

Two of the headers listed above are Drupal-specific. By default, WordPress does not send any additional HTTP headers. However, it is possible for plugins and themes to send them.
