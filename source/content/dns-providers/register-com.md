## Before You Begin
Be sure that you have a:

- Registered domain name using Cloudflare to host DNS
- [Paid Pantheon plan](/guides/launch/plans)
- [Domain connected](/guides/launch/domains) to the target Pantheon environment (typically Live)

## Configure DNS Records on Cloudflare

### A Record
1. Click **DNS** in the menu bar.
2. Select **A** from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter **@** in the **Name** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon in the **IPv4 Address** field.
4. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).

    <Accordion title="Learn More" id="ttl" icon="info-sign">

    #### Time to Live (TTL)

    The TTL dictates the lifespan of a DNS record; a shorter time means less time to wait until the changes go into effect. TTLs are always set in seconds with a few common ones being 86400 (24 hours),  43200 (12 hours), and 3600 (1 hour).

    When you make a change to the TTL of an existing record, you need to wait for the old TTL time to pass - that is, if it had been set to 86400, you would need to wait a full 24 hours for the new setting to begin propagating everywhere.

5. Disable Cloudflare's CDN by clicking the cloud icon (should be gray, not orange).
6. Click **Add Record**.

### AAAA Records
1. Select **AAAA** from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter **@** in the **Name** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon in the **IPv6 Address** field.
3. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).
4. Disable Cloudflare's CDN by clicking the cloud icon (should be gray, not orange).
5. Click **Add Record**.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the second AAAA record value provided by Pantheon. There are two AAAA records for improved uptime and reliability.

### A Record for subdomain
The A record is required if you wish to include `www` within your site's primary domain name.

1. Select **A** from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter **www** in the **Name** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon (e.g. `23.185.0.2`) in the **IPv4 Address** field.
3. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).
4. Disable Cloudflare's CDN by clicking the cloud icon (should be gray, not orange).
5. Click **Add Record**.
