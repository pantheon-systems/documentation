## Before You Begin
Be sure that you have a:

- Registered domain name using Namecheap to host DNS
- [Paid Pantheon plan](/guides/launch/plans)
- [Domain connected](/guides/launch/domains) to the target Pantheon environment (typically Live)

## Locate Pantheon's DNS Values
Identify DNS values to point your domain to Pantheon:

1. Navigate to the Site Dashboard and select the target environment (typically <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live) then click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-global"></span> Domains / HTTPS**.
2. Click the **Details** button next to your domain.

Keep this page open and login to your [Namecheap account](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login.aspx) in a new tab before you continue.

## Configure DNS Records on Namecheap

### A Record
2. Select **Domain List** then click the **Manage** button next to the domain you want to point to Pantheon.
3. Navigate to **Advanced DNS** and click the **Add New Record** button.
4. Select **A Record** for Type and enter **@** in the **Host** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon in the **Value** field.
5. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).

    <Accordion title="Learn More" id="ttl" icon="info-sign">

    #### Time to Live (TTL)

    The TTL dictates the lifespan of a DNS record; a shorter time means less time to wait until the changes go into effect. TTLs are always set in seconds with a few common ones being 86400 (24 hours),  43200 (12 hours), and 3600 (1 hour).

    When you make a change to the TTL of an existing record, you need to wait for the old TTL time to pass - that is, if it had been set to 86400, you would need to wait a full 24 hours for the new setting to begin propagating everywhere.

6. Click **Save changes**.

### AAAA Records
1. From the **Advanced DNS** tab, click the **Add New Record** button.
2. Select **AAAA Record** for Type and enter **@** in the **Host** field and enter the first AAAA record value provided by Pantheon in the **Value** field.
3. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).
4. Click **Save changes**.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the second AAAA record value provided by Pantheon. There are two AAAA records for improved uptime and reliability.

### A Record for subdomain
An A record is required to configure a subdomain (e.g., `www.example.com`).

1. From the **Advanced DNS** tab, click the **Add New Record** button.
2. Select **A Record** for the Type and enter **www** in the **Host** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon (e.g. `23.185.0.2`) in the **Value** field.
3. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).
4. Click **Save changes**.
