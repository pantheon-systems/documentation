<Alert type="danger" title="Warning">

Network Solutions does not support AAAA records for IPv6 traffic which can negatively impact performance, especially on mobile devices. We recommend transferring DNS services to a provider that supports IPv6.

</Alert>

## Before You Begin
Be sure that you have a:

- Registered domain name using Network Solutions to host DNS
- [Paid Pantheon plan](/guides/launch/plans)
- [Domain connected](/guides/launch/domains) to the target Pantheon environment (typically Live)

## Locate Pantheon's DNS Values
Identify DNS values to point your domain to Pantheon:

1. Navigate to the Site Dashboard and select the target environment (typically <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live) then click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-global"></span> Domains / HTTPS**.
2. Click the **Details** button next to your domain.

Keep this page open and login to your [Network Solutions account](https://www.networksolutions.com) in a new tab before you continue.

## Configure DNS Records on Network Solutions

### A Record
1. Navigate to **Account Manager** > **My Domain Names**
2. Select the domain you want to point to Pantheon, then click **Manage**.
3. Click **Change Where Domain Points**, then select **Advanced DNS**.
4. In the IP Address (A records) section, click **Edit A Records**.
5. The domain likely has a few default values for `www` and the bare domain. Paste the IP address provided by Pantheon in the Numeric IP field for the existing `@ (None)` record, then delete any default records like so:

  ![Network Solutions Edit A Records](../../images/dns/networksolutions/default-a-records.png)

6. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).

    <Accordion title="Learn More" id="ttl" icon="info-sign">

    #### Time to Live (TTL)

    The TTL dictates the lifespan of a DNS record; a shorter time means less time to wait until the changes go into effect. TTLs are always set in seconds with a few common ones being 86400 (24 hours),  43200 (12 hours), and 3600 (1 hour).

    When you make a change to the TTL of an existing record, you need to wait for the old TTL time to pass - that is, if it had been set to 86400, you would need to wait a full 24 hours for the new setting to begin propagating everywhere.

    </Accordion>

7. Click **Save Changes**.
8. Once changes are saved, the section of the Advanced DNS interface for A records should look like this:

### A Record for Subdomain
An A record is required to configure a subdomain (e.g., `www.example.com`).

1. In the IP Address (A records) section, click **Edit A Records**.
2. Edit the **www** record field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon (e.g. `23.185.0.2`) in the **Numeric IP** field.
3. Select desired Time to Live (TTL).
4. Click **Save Changes**.

### AAAA Records
AAAA records can be set via the [Adding an IPv6 record](http://www.networksolutions.com/support/Adding-an-IPv6-record/) instructions on the Network Solutions docs and require an email to their support to complete.
