## Before You Begin

Be sure that you have a:

- Registered domain name using Cloudflare to host DNS
- [Paid Pantheon plan](/guides/launch/plans)
- [Domain connected](/guides/launch/domains) to the target Pantheon environment (typically Live)

## Configure DNS Records on Cloudflare

### A Record

1. Click **DNS** in the menu bar.

1. Select **A** from the dropdown menu.

1. Enter **@** in the **Name** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon in the **IPv4 Address** field.

1. Set the TTL to **30 minutes**.

1. Disable Cloudflare's CDN by clicking the cloud icon (should be gray, not orange).

1. Click **Add Record**.

### AAAA Records

1. Select **AAAA** from the dropdown menu.

1. Enter **@** in the **Name** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon in the **IPv6 Address** field.

1. Set the TTL to **30 minutes**.

1. Disable Cloudflare's CDN by clicking the cloud icon (should be gray, not orange).

1. Click **Add Record**.

1. Repeat steps 1-5 for the second AAAA record value provided by Pantheon. There are two AAAA records for improved uptime and reliability.

### Subdomains
Create one A record and 2 AAAA records for the given subdomain (e.g., `www.example.com`):

1. Select **A** from the dropdown menu.

1. Enter **www** in the **Name** field and enter the A record value provided by Pantheon (e.g. `23.185.0.2`) in the **IPv4 Address** field.

1. Set the TTL to **30 minutes**.

1. Disable Cloudflare's CDN by clicking the cloud icon (should be gray, not orange).

1. Click **Add Record**.

1. Repeat steps 1-5 for the two AAAA records.


### TXT Record

The TXT record is only required if you need to prove ownership of your domain in order to pre-provision certificates to avoid HTTPS service interruption.

1. Select **TXT** from the dropdown menu.

1. Leave the **Name** field blank and enter the record value provided by Pantheon in the **TXT Content** field.

1. Set the TTL to **30 minutes**.

1. Click **Add Record**.
