## Befor you begin

* Do you have admin access to your GitHub repository?
* Do you have access to create new Next.js sites on Pantheon?
* Do you have access to your DNS provider to update DNS records?

### Differences between Front-End Sites and new Next.js sites

## Replicating your Front-End Site on new Next.js infrastructure

### Connect the GitHub application to your repository

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus site:create my-site-name my-site-label nextjs15 \
--org="My Pantheon Org name" \
--vcs-provider=github \
--vcs-org=my-github-org-name \
--repository-name=name-of-the-existing-repo
--no-create-repo
```

(Even if your codebase is not spefic to Next.js 15, use the `nextjs15` option to create the site.)

This command will provision new infrastructure for your Next.js site and will take a few minutes to complete. You can monitor the progress of the initial build in the Pantheon Dashboard or by using the [Node Logs Plugin for Terminus](/nextjs/cli-tools).

For many sites, builds will fail until required environment variables are set.

### Replicate environment variables as Pantheon secrets

Front-End Sites provided a dashboard interface for setting environment variables.
The new Next.js support on Pantheon uses [Secrets Manager](/guides/secrets) to set environment variables.

### Confirm your site is working as expected

Once your environment variables are set, and another build process has completed without error, confirm that your site is working as expected in the Dev environment.

## Going Live

### Consider your workflow for deploying code changes to Test and Live environments

One of the key differences between Front-End Sites and the new Next.js support on Pantheon is the automatic inclusion of Test and Live environments.

Front-End Sites was designed to have a Live environment a non-live environments (per pull request or specially named "Multidev" environments) only.

Like our infrastructure for PHP-based sites, the new Next.js support on Pantheon includes Dev, Test, and Live environments by default.
Your `main` branch will deploy to Dev and deployments to [Test and Live will be triggered by Git tags](/nextjs/test-and-live-env).
Depending on your perspective this change could be a beneficial safeguard or an inconvenience.

If you prefer a workflow in which code changes deploy to Live immediately upon merging to `main`, you can consider using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to automate the creation of Git tags upon merges to `main`. That tactic is described within our documentation on [Deploying to Test and Live using Git tags](/nextjs/test-and-live-env).

### Connect your custom domain to the new Live environment

To connect a custom domain name to your Live environment, follow the instructions in [Connecting a Custom Domain Name](/nextjs/connecting-custom-domain-name).
