**DNS** stands for Domain Name System, and it's the protocol by which domain names are pointed to the servers that host content. When adding a [custom domain](/domains/#custom-domains) to your site, we provide the values for your DNS records, to be assigned with your DNS service provider:

![DNS Recommendations](../images/dashboard/domain-added.png)

While Pantheon does not offer DNS management services, we can help you to understand how DNS works, and configure your domain to point to your Pantheon site.

## DNS Terminology

### TLD

<dfn id="tld">

The <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> is the last piece of your website URL (`.com`, `.net`, `.org`, etc)

</dfn>

### Registrar

A <dfn id="registrar">Registrar</dfn> is the service through which you purchase a domain name. Most registrars also offer DNS management services.

### Domain

The last section of your website name before the [TLD](#tld), the <dfn>domain</dfn> is what you purchase from the [Registrar](#registrar).

### Subdomain

Separates by periods (`.`), <dfn>subdomains</dfn> precede the domain name. `www` is the most commonly seen subdomain. Subdomains can also stack (example: `www.something.example.com`).

### Authoritative Name Server

An <dfn>Authoritative Name Server</dfn> publishes your domain's DNS records

## DNS Record Types

| Name     | Description                                      |
|:-------- |:------------------------------------------------ |
| `A`      | Points a domain or subdomain to an IPv4 address. |
| `AAAA`   | Points a domain or subdomain to an IPv6 address. |
| `CNAME`  | Points a domain or subdomain
| `MX`     | Used to specify email servers. Note that Pantheon does not offer email services, so your MX records shouldn't be pointed at Pantheon. |
| `TXT`    | These are generic records, used by many services for different things. |
| `NS`     | Specifies where the authoritative name servers for this domain are. |

## DNS propagation

Every DNS record has a **Time To Live** (**TTL**) value, which specifies how long any DNS server should hold that record, before dropping it and asking for a new version from its upstream DNS provider. TTLs are usually set in seconds with a few common ones being `86400` (24 hours),  `43200` (12 hours), `3600` (1 hour), and `500` (5 minutes).

**DNS Propagation** is the time it takes for changes made to DNS records to be reflected across DNS servers globally. A lower TTL value means faster propagation, but it's important to note that it is not a 1:1 ratio. Between your [authoritative name server](#where-are-my-dns-records-hosted) and the DNS servers of any particular ISP could be any number of intermediate DNS servers. Each server in that chain will wait for the records it holds to expire before requesting new ones. Because of this, it can take *several times longer* than your record's TTL value to see changes reflected for everyone.

### DNS Migration Prep

When you're planning a site migration, follow these simple steps to help minimize DNS-related downtime:

1. Lower the TTL values as low as allowed (usually `500`) several days in advance at your DNS service manager. That way when the values are changed, new records are propagated faster.

2. Use `dig` to confirm the new TTL values have propagated to your ISP's DNS servers:

    ```bash{outputLines:2}
    dig +nocmd +noall +answer pantheon.io
    pantheon.io.            60      IN      A       23.185.0.2
    ```

    In the example above, the TTL of the A record for`pantheon.io` is 60 seconds.

3. Once the migration is complete, raise the TTL values back to `3600` (24 hours) to improve stability in case of a DNS service outage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are my DNS records hosted?

DNS Records are hosted by an **authoritative name server**. This may or may not also be the **registrar** who you purchased the domain name from. You can use the command line tool **dig** to look up the `NS` record for a domain to find the name server:

```bash{outputLines:2-5}
dig +short ns pantheon.io
ns-1096.awsdns-09.org.
ns-148.awsdns-18.com.
ns-1857.awsdns-40.co.uk.
ns-924.awsdns-51.net.
```

The example above shows that the records for `pantheon.io` are hosted by AWS.

To find the registrar where your domain is registered, use the command line tool **whois**:

```bash{outputLines:2}
whois pantheon.io | grep Registrar:
Registrar: Gandi SAS
```

The example above uses `| grep Registrar:` to filter the results to what we're looking for specifically. Remove it to see the full output of the `whois` command. Our example shows that the domain `pantheon.io` is registered with Gandi.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Your registrar may appear to have DNS records for your domain and still not be the authoritative name server. Use `dig` as described above to confirm the name server in use.

### Can I buy my domain or manage DNS with Pantheon?

No, Pantheon is neither a domain registrar nor a DNS manager. Many platforms and hosting providers offer DNS servers and while it's convenient, it's often inflexible. Providers that offer nameservers usually build other features (like HTTPS) in a way that will only work for customers who use the provided nameservers. This approach is fine until it interferes with more advanced deployments.

<Accordion title="Learn More" id="nameservers-drop" icon="lightbulb">

Pantheon is built to support advanced website deployment needs, and that means allowing site owners to use the DNS provider of their choice. If Pantheon required specific nameservers, it would interfere with these major use cases (among others):

* **Large organizations and institutions with Information Technology departments that operate or configure DNS.** If Pantheon required use of particular DNS servers, it would interfere with the ability to use Pantheon for the organization's websites.
* **Digitally signing DNS records using a system like [DNSSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions).** While it would be technically possible for Pantheon to host records signed offline, it's much easier for interested organizations to operate their own DNS or choose a provider that supports the desired signing methods.
* **Uncommon record types.** If Pantheon required use of specific nameservers, it's unlikely that all of the desired record types would be available, particularly legacy ones.
* **Programmatic updates.** Such use cases include domain control validation for obtaining certificates and automated responses to security events. Different DNS services support different update APIs, and it's unlikely Pantheon would ever be able to support them all.

If your site doesn't have these advanced needs, there are free and inexpensive options outside of Pantheon. We recommend considering your domain registrar's DNS services, [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/), or [Cloudflare](https://woorkup.com/cloudflare-dns/).

### Why does the `www` subdomain redirect to the bare domain?

Some DNS providers provide a default `CNAME` record for `www` pointing to `@` (the bare domain). Remove these records and replace them with the records suggested by the Pantheon Site Dashboard.

Note that if the Platform detects a CNAME record, the DNS **Status** will show `Remove this detected record` on the line with the CNAME. Remove the CNAME from the DNS management service to avoid potential issues or interruptions.

### What are `AAAA` records, and do I need them?

**AAAA** or "quad-A" records are used to assign [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) addresses to domain names. While most of the internet still uses IPv4, the address pool has been exhausted and IPv6 became the standard as of July 14th, 2017.

`AAAA` records are not required, but recommended as a best practice for performance, especially for mobile devices.

Pantheon provides IPv6 addresses for you to assign `AAAA` records to. If your DNS service does not support `AAAA` you can simply omit these records for now, but consider asking your provider to add functionality, as the need for IPv6 will only increase in the future.

Some DNS service providers require expanded `AAAA` records. You can retrieve the expanded version for each AAAA record by using the [IPv6 conversion tool](http://ipv6-literal.com/) and copying the "IPv6 longest" result.

### What about my `MX` records for email?

Pantheon does not provide email services. Make sure your DNS records include an `MX` record that points to a subdomain (like `mail`), which in turn has an `A` or `CNAME` record pointing it to your email provider.

### What is the difference between an `A` and `CNAME` record?

An `A` record points a domain name to an IPv4 address. A `CNAME` record points a domain name to *another* domain, but *does not* redirect to it.

Pantheon provides `A` and `AAAA` values:

![DNS Values provided by the Pantheon Site Dashboard](../images/dashboard/dns-values.png)

<Accordion title="Learn More" id="example-panel" icon="education">

In the past, Pantheon used a mix of  `A`/`AAAA` and `CNAME` records. We've since standardized to only `A`/`AAAA`, which reduces complexity and confusion. `CNAME` records introduce an additional point of failure by requiring an additional lookup from `CNAME` to `A` before getting an IP address.

Additionally, the use of an `MX` or `TXT` record prevents the use of a `CNAME`, and vice versa.

</Accordion>

### Why does my domain say "Update Recommended?"

The **Status** in **Domains / HTTPS** will show as <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-alert text-warning"></span> **Update Recommended** when the Platform detects a CNAME record pointed to Pantheon, or when A/AAAA records are not detected.

Click **Details** to find the values required for A and AAAA records to add, or to find the CNAME detected on the line with `Remove this detected record` in the status.

Log in to your DNS provider to make the recommended changes. We have instructions for [many popular DNS providers](/dns-providers) to help make the required adjustment.

### Can I override DNS locally?

Yes! You can modify your local `hosts` file, which takes precedence over DNS:
