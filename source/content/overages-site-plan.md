Pantheon customers are positioned to generate the most value from [WebOps](https://pantheon.io/webops?docs). Improving the uptime and performance of your site is an essential component of the service Pantheon provides.

The number of unique visits displayed in [Pantheonâ€™s Site Dashboard](/metrics) determines the traffic Pantheon will apply for evaluating use on your site under your pricing plan. For more information about how Pantheon measures site traffic, see the [Traffic Limits and Overages](/traffic-limits) doc.
