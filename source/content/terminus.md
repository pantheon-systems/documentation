The Terminus command line interface provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do almost everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, and much more.

Install Terminus on macOS or Linux. Windows 10 users can install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). For details on legacy versions of Terminus, see [Legacy Terminus Versions](/terminus/get-started/legacy/).
