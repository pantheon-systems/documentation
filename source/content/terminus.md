Our command line interface, Terminus, provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do almost everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, and much more.

[Install Terminus](/terminus/install) on Mac OS X or Linux. For details on legacy versions of Terminus, see [Legacy Terminus Versions](/terminus/get-started/legacy).
