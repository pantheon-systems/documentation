## [Advanced Page Cache](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_advanced_page_cache)
The Advanced Page Cache module attaches [Drupal's cache metadata](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/cache-api/cache-api) to a response so that Pantheon's [Global CDN](/docs/global-cdn/) edge service can granularly clear new content as it is saved. The Global CDN can detect when underlying data changes, such as nodes and taxonomy terms, then clear pages containing that entity. For details, see [this blog post](https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-advanced-page-cache-drupal-cache-metadata-global-cdn).


## [LCache](https://www.drupal.org/project/lcache)
LCache is a module that applies the tiered caching model of multi-core processors (with local L1 and central L2 caches) to web applications. This allows scaling cache read access independently of network throughput. The current production implementation uses APCu as L1 and the database as L2.

## [Site Audit](https://www.drupal.org/project/site_audit)
Static site analysis as a service for Drupal sites to make best practice recommendations on site configurations. These reports are found in the Site Dashboard under the Status tab and are accessible by site team members. For more details, see [Launch Check - Drupal Performance and Configuration Analysis](/docs/drupal-launch-check/).

## [Search API Pantheon (Drupal 8)](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_pantheon)
This module is meant to simplify the usage of [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) and [Search API Solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) on Pantheon. Search API Solr provides the ability to connect to any Solr server by providing numerous configuration options. This module automatically sets the Solr connection options by extending the plugin from Search API Solr. The module also changes the connection information between Pantheon environments, eliminating the need to do extra work setting up Solr servers for each environment.

## [Drupal 8 Cache Backport (Drupal 7)](https://www.drupal.org/project/d8cache)
Drupal 8 Cache Backport is a module that brings Drupal 8 cache tags and cache max-age back to Drupal 7 (If there is interest, cache contexts will follow).

## [Generate Errors (Drupal 7)](https://www.drupal.org/project/generate_errors)
Interface which allows you to generate various errors, to test system behaviors like custom errors and server responses.

## [Pantheon Module (Drupal 7)](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/tree/master/modules/pantheon)
This module provides general methods your site needs to access aspects of the internal Pantheon API. This is necessary for clearing caches from our reverse-proxy/edge cache, as well as provisioning new Solr cores and other features. It should always be enabled for all sites on Pantheon and should not cause adverse effects if you export the site locally or to another environment.

The code for the API module is available within our upstream repositories, in the `modules/pantheon` directory. The functionality of this module is provided in three parts: Apache Solr, Pantheon Platform API, and Login.

### [Pantheon Platform API](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/blob/master/modules/pantheon/pantheon_api/pantheon_api.info)
This module provides general methods your site needs to access aspects of the internal Pantheon API. This is necessary for clearing caches and other common workflows on the platform.

Note: Currently, there is no API module available for Drupal 8.

### [Apache Solr](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/tree/master/modules/pantheon/pantheon_apachesolr)
This module facilitates and debugs communication between Drupal and Pantheon's Apache Solr service, indexing and searching site content. For more details, see [Apache Solr on Pantheon](/docs/solr/).

### [Login](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/tree/master/modules/pantheon/pantheon_login)
Provides login integration between Drupal and the Pantheon Site Dashboard.
