## Overview

The new generation of our Serverless PHP runtime represents our commitment to providing a modern, secure, and efficient PHP runtime for your websites.

Depending on your website's features, this new PHP runtime may have major effects on the operation of your site. During the beta phase, we invite you to test your site for compatibility and performance to ensure a seamless upgrade. The previous generation will be removed in early 2026.

## What's included?

- Long Term Support (LTS) coverage for EOL PHP versions (PHP 5.6+)
- Better CMS functionality via updated PHP extensions
- PHP 8.4 availability

## Beta Phase (April - September 16, 2025)

During the beta phase, you can opt in to test your sites on the new PHP runtime. The opt-in is environment-based, meaning you can trial the new PHP runtime without affecting your other environments. This allows you to:

- Verify your site's compatibility before the platform-wide rollout
- Test your deployment workflows
- Identify any potential issues early
- Provide valuable feedback to our team

It is safe to use the PHP Runtime Generation 2 beta on a Live environment once you have confirmed site compatibility.

### How to Opt In

To enable the second generation PHP runtime for an environment, add the following to your `pantheon.yml`:

```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
php_runtime_generation: 2
```

To safely revert to the previous generation, use the following:

```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
php_runtime_generation: 1
```

Since any `pantheon.yml` changes are part of your site repository and promoted if you push to test or live, we recommend using a multidev or removing the `php_runtime_generation` parameter before promoting any code while you are testing compatibility.
