Drupal 10 is available to all new sites, and is available as an [upgrade path for Drupal 9 sites](/drupal-10#upgrade-a-drupal-9-site-to-drupal-10). Refer to [Drupal 10 on Pantheon](/drupal-10) for more information.

Drupal 9 is similarly available on Pantheon to all new sites, and as an [upgrade path for Drupal 8+ sites](/drupal-migration).

Since Drupal itself is in active development and each new version brings a number of significant changes from previous versions, this doc outlines the biggest changes and answers frequently asked questions.

## About Drupal

Drupal includes many of the features and layout that Drupal users are familiar with, and it removes deprecated code to help improve future Drupal development.

The latest version of Drupal updates Drupalâ€™s underlying dependencies like [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), removes several deprecated API functions in favor of better options, and allows everyone running Drupal 8.8+ an easy upgrade path to Drupal and beyond.

## Drupal With Integrated Composer

On the Pantheon Platform, Drupal sites use [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer), letting you deploy your site on Pantheon with one-click updates for both upstream commits and Composer dependencies, while still receiving upstream updates.

### Site Structure

<Partial file="ic-upstream-structure.md" />

### Managing Dependencies with Composer

Learn more about working with upstream and site dependencies in the [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) documentation.

## Before You Begin

- Log in to your Pantheon account. If you don't have one, [create one first](https://pantheon.io/register?docs) and familiarize yourself with the [User Dashboard](/guides/quickstart/user-dashboard) before you create a new site.

- Set up [SSH Keys](/ssh-keys) on your local computer and Pantheon account.

- Install and configure [Git](/guides/git/git-config) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) on your local computer.

- Mac users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install both Git, Composer,  and Terminus along with their required dependencies:

     ```bash{promptUser:user}
     brew install git composer pantheon-systems/external/terminus
     ```

## Create a New Drupal Site with Integrated Composer

[Create a new Drupal site from the Dashboard](/guides/legacy-dashboard/create-sites) as you would with any new site. Integrated Composer is built in and ready to use.

## Upgrade or Migrate to Drupal

To upgrade or migrate an existing Drupal site to Drupal with Integrated Composer, see the [Drupal Migration Guide](/drupal-migration).

To check an existing site's compatibility to upgrade, visit the appropriate [Drupal Migration Guide](/drupal-migration).

## Gutenberg for Drupal

After you upgrade to Drupal you may consider upgrading the authoring experience for your content creators as well. We recommend using [Gutenberg](https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg) for a better user experience, including:

 - Creating, saving, and reusing content blocks
 - Easier build process for landing pages
 - Scalable performance

You can read more about Pantheon's experience with Gutenberg in [Gutenberg on Drupal : An Opportunity](https://pantheon.io/blog/gutenberg-drupal-9).

You can also read more about the installation process on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/gutenberg/installation-and-upgrades).

We recommend monitoring your site's traffic using [Metrics in the Site Dashboard](/guides/legacy-dashboard/metrics) to check for increased traffic after installing Gutenberg.

## Troubleshooting and Support

See the appropriate [Drupal Migration Guide](/drupal-migration) for help troubleshooting common issues with Drupal with Integrated Composer.

### Where can I report an issue?

[Contact support](/guides/support) to report any issues that you encounter.

### Can I Use Lando or Localdev for Drupal?

Some users have reported success using [Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/) with Drupal, but it relies on a workaround and requires extra configuration. Check the status of the [Lando repo's issue](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2831#issuecomment-771833900) before you continue.

Manually update the [landofile](https://docs.lando.dev/config/lando.html#base-file) in the project folder, and set `drupal9` as the framework:

  ```yml:title=lando.yml
  # Lando issue 2831 workaround for D9
  framework: drupal9
  ```

When you create a project with Lando from the Pantheon recipe, the `framework` will default to `drupal8` for a Drupal site.

If you created new project with Lando, change the value for `framework` to `drupal8`, then run `lando rebuild`.

### Site-local Drush Is Required for Drupal Sites

Do not remove `drush/drush` from `composer.json`. If it's removed, `terminus drush` commands will fail with errors related to Twig.
