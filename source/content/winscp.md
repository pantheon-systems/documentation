[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) is an open source graphical SFTP client for Windows that also supports the Legacy SCP protocol.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the Pantheon SFTP connection information for your site ready. If you need to locate the connection information, see the documentation on [how to find the SFTP credentials](/sftp#sftp-connection-information) for your site.

## Download WinSCP

If you do not have WinSCP installed, [download and install the latest version](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/installation#download).

## Start the WinSCP Client

Start the WinSCP application and enter the connection information. Be sure to take note of the port as Pantheon uses a **non-standard port** for SFTP.

## Add the RSA2 Key Fingerprint

Click **Yes** to accept the server's host key for the current session so it is stored in cache. This allows you to connect to the server and manage your files for the current session.

## Manage Files

Once you are logged in, you are directed to the root directory of your appserver. On the left side you will see your local computer, and on the right you will see your site's appserver. To get to the Drupal or WordPress root, navigate to the `code` directory and manage your files.
