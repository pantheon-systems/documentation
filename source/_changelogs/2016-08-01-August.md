##Platform Improvements

### Advanced Site Configurations Available
Nested docroot: Serve sites from a `web` subdirectory, one-level beneath the root of your code repository. Among other use cases, this helps facilitate managing dependencies via Composer.
Protected Web Paths: Specify files or directories that you don’t want to be publicly web-accessible.
PHP Version: Now your site’s PHP version is managed via [pantheon.yml](https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-yml/) so it’s in version control and deployed along with the rest of your code.

### New Hooks for Quicksilver Platform Integration
You can now automatically trigger a script after creating a site or Multidev. Check out slack_notifcation so all your team members know when a new Multidev or site is created. View all example [Quicksilver scripts](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples/) on GitHub.

### PHP 5.6/7.0 Released
We now support PHP 5.6 and 7.0. See our documentation to learn how to [upgrade your PHP version](https://pantheon.io/docs/php-versions/).

### Docs Site Updated
We redesigned the [Docs home page](https://pantheon.io/docs/). Check it out and let us know what you think!

### Solr Power for WordPress 0.5 Update
We released an update for the [Solr Power WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/solr-power/) which adds a Solr search widget that supports faceting. If you have any input please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power).

### Terminus 0.12.0
The latest release has huge performance improvements for users with lots of sites. Check out the [Terminus Changelog](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see what’s new and get the [latest version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli/releases).
