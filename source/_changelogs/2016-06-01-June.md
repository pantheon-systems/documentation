## Platform Improvements

### New Relic Pro
Previously, the Pro level of service was only available as a two-week trial. Now, Pro won’t end after just two weeks. New Relic APM Pro gives code and query level visibility into application performance, allowing you to quickly pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

### Drupal 8 Site Imports Now Supported
Previously, existing Drupal 8 sites had to be manually imported to Pantheon. Now, you are able to use the Importer tool on your Pantheon Dashboard.

### New Reliable Screenshots Microservice & User Dashboard Design Update
Your User Dashboard now shows a screenshot of each site’s Dev environment and uses a default image if no screenshot is available. An update is triggered when clearing caches, deploying code, and cloning or importing database or files to Dev.

### New Migration Button on the Dashboard
We added a **Migrate Existing Site** button to the User and Organization Dashboards to help guide you through the import process.
