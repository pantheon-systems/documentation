## Global CDN
The most advanced content delivery network for Drupal and WordPress is now integrated directly into Pantheon. We've partnered with Fastly to deliver traffic across their edge cloud platform, and we've integrated Let's Encrypt to provide HTTPS free to all sites on our platform. This means sites on Pantheon will run even faster, content will be delivered even closer to users, and HTTPS on Pantheon is now automatic and free—forever.

## Platform Improvements
### Custom Upstreams: Self-serve GitHub and Bitbucket
Organizations using a [Custom Upstream](/docs/custom-upstream) can now add and manage their upstreams without engaging Pantheon Support.

If your organization doesn’t yet use Custom Upstreams, and you are interested in access to this feature, [tell us about your use-case](https://pantheon.io/agencies/learn-pantheon?docs).

### Terminus 1.4.1
If you haven’t updated Terminus recently, checkout the [Terminus Changelog](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates/#changelog) to see what’s new and update to the [current release](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates/#update-to-the-current-release-)
### Drupal 8 with Redirect and Simple XML Sitemap modules now supported
We fixed an issue in our Nginx web server configuration that causes infinite redirect loops.
### Nginx Web Server Integer Overflow Vulnerability Mitigated
Although our analysis indicated our customers were not likely subject to this vulnerability, we applied the recommended remediation for [CVE-2017-7529](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7529).

### Drupal Core Upgrades
[Drupal 8.3.5](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.3.5) has been [pushed](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/190/commits/5736e0c6dde418547ed95f61ac6b479d7ae17146) to all Drupal Site Dashboards.
